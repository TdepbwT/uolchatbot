The BSc (Hons) Bioveterinary Science degree at Lincoln gives students the opportunity to explore the science that underlies animal health and disease. The degree combines key concepts in animal science with relevant laboratory, field, and computer analysis. 
Students are introduced to the processes surrounding animal health including life histories of pathogens and parasites, infection and immunity, preventative measures, diagnosis, and treatments. There is the opportunity to study these issues in a range of animal species, including exotic, companion, livestock and wild animals, as well as in humans.

How You Study
The first year of the degree introduces health and disease in the context of animal anatomy and physiology, cell biology, genetics, and the biochemistry of metabolism.
The second year builds on this, with further specialist study of animal health and disease, also providing the opportunity for students to pursue individual interests within a wide range of topics, including animal behaviour, protection, toxicology, and reproduction.
In the final year, students embark upon individual research projects and are provided the opportunity to travel overseas to participate in research field trips as part of the optional Overseas Field Course module. Further specialist modules including Control of Animal Disease and Veterinary Parasitology can be chosen to complete the final year.
Students undertaking research projects have access to a range of advanced facilities including equipment for cytometry and confocal microscopy, as well as a bioacoustics lab. Our animal behaviour laboratory includes aquatic and reptile provision alongside an insectary.

", 'Students undertaking research projects have access to a range of advanced facilities including equipment for cytometry and confocal microscopy. We have access to reptiles, and to a working cattle and sheep farm which is ideal for projects, as well as microbiology and molecular biology laboratories.
There is also an element of self-directed study to this course. This may include reading of scientific papers, watching videos to begin to understand difficult issues, or research into an area of your interest. The course tutors are researchers and are keen to work with students to understand difficult issues, discuss issues, or offer help and support where possible.
Modules
 Some courses may offer optional modules. The availability of optional modules may vary from year to year and will be subject to minimum student numbers being achieved.

We also do poster presentations, and a viva voce exam in the final year to help students to prepare for work interviews.
Overseas Field Trip
There is an optional overseas field trip in the third year. This will provide the opportunity to do research in a novel environment and to study local plants and animals. Destinations may vary, but have previously included the cloud forests of Ecuador, the Mankwe Wildlife Reserve in South Africa, andMolise in Italy.
Optional field trips may incur additional costs, including flights. Students may also be required to pay for overnight stays, local travel, and food close to the destination if their flights arrive the day before the team are scheduled to meet.Students may bring personal items of clothing and travel equipment, some of which may be specialised for the environment they are travelling to, and recommended medicines and travel toiletries such as anti-malaria medication, vaccinations, insect repellent, and sunscreen. These costs will depend on what you choose to bring.

Students on this course can take part in an optional overseas field trip in the third year to study plants and animals in the wild.
Destinations may vary, but have previously included the cloud forests of Ecuador, the Mankwe Wildlife Reserve in South Africa, and Molise in Italy.
On each trip students are introduced to local flora and fauna, present a group project, and complete an identification test of plants, vertebrates, and invertebrates.
Optional Placement Year
All full-time students on this course may take an optional placement year between the second and third year of the programme. While these placements are student-led, you will be continuously supported by academic staff throughout. Placements provide the opportunity to gain workplace experience and a chance to hone your skills in a professional environment. While you are on an optional placement in the UK, you will be required to cover your own transport, accommodation, and meals costs. These placements are ideal for developing key skills that employers look for. Previous students have been on work placements at Pirbright, Dechra Pharmaceuticals, and the Animal and Plant Health Agency.
The absolute highlight of my time at university was the chance to take the overseas field course module. I opted to go to South Africa, which was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
