 requirements and our graduates' skills to improve employability and help their transition from higher education into work.", 'The combination of modules offered is designed to build subject knowledge and skills required for graduate careers in both engineering and disciplines branching from it. Opportunities such as our year in research and industry placement are embedded within the programme to further affirm those skills in real-world contexts relevant to your own career ambitions. 
The first year, which will be common across all General Engineering programmes, will lay foundations in fields such as mechanical, electrical, and mechatronic engineering. Students on the BEng programme will then go on in years two and three to develop some aspects of these fields further, as well as developing an appreciation of their interrelatedness and applications of this knowledge in a variety of contexts.
The programme uses a range of teaching methods including scheduled teaching sessions, directed independent study activities, and self-directed independent study.

How you are assessed
Assessment on the programme is designed to measure and assess engineering technical and analytical skills as well as professional soft skills including oral and written communication, team working, long-life learning, problem-solving, project management, and planning and organisation.
Coursework assignments are used in a number of modules where students are required to work on their own or in small groups. They are designed to enable students to develop and show their understanding of the module content. Oral presentations are often included as part of coursework to provide opportunities for developing essential communication skills. The programme also includes online, time constrained assessments (TCAs).
Students are expected to complete an individual project in their final year of the degree course, providing an excellent opportunity to pull together every aspect of their development during the course.
