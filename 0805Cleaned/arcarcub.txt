How You Study
On this course, students can study the underlying concepts of architecture and the ways in which a building can meet the needs of its occupants and the society.
During the course, students work on a series of independent and collaborative studio-based projects. They have the opportunity to shape their learning in line with their interests, within the context of the architecture curriculum.
The programme aims to release creative potential, explore design processes, and lay a foundation of cultural and technical knowledge. Students have the opportunity to participate in practical explorations of materials and construction techniques which can lead to adventurous designs.
Students are expected to learn important drawing techniques, alongside computer-aided design (CAD), and hands-on modelling and construction.
The course is designed to address the social, theoretical, technical, technological, and contextual issues of living in the contemporary city. Design projects aim to build confidence in responding with imagination, humanity, and concern for the environment.
The studio is the main laboratory for teaching and learning on this course. In the studio, students work with academic staff who supervise their projects and guide them through the design process.
Lectures and seminars introduce topics such as humanities, environment, and technology. Students may participate in workshops, external visits, and fieldwork.
