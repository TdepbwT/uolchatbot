Academic Years
Forensic scientists provide impartial evidence in criminal investigations through their scientific expertise. They work in laboratories, at crime scenes, and in courtrooms, utilising their highly developed biology and chemistry skills. Their highly detailed work encompasses elements of chemistry and biology applied in areas such as toxicology, DNA analysis, and trace evidence.
The BSc (Hons) Forensic Science degree is designed to help students develop the skills and knowledge required by forensic scientists in order to apply scientific expertise in criminal investigations. The degree aims to develop skills and knowledge in a range of forensic science tasks, including crime scene investigation, physical evidence collection, sample analysis, and defence of testimony. This academically challenging course combines a broad spectrum of subjects, including advanced chemical and biological analysis, forensic toxicology, and crime scene management.
