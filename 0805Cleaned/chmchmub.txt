Academic Years
Concerned with the study of matter, its properties and reactions, chemistry plays a key role in tackling global challenges such as energy production, health and wellbeing, food security and the use of natural resources. The programme aims to develop the analytical and practical skills required to prepare students for a wide range of science-related careers. 
At Lincoln, we aim to integrate the core chemistry disciplines with advanced topics aligned to the major scientific challenges of the 21st Century. These include nanoscience for new materials and devices, the chemistry/biology interface for drugs discovery, nuclear chemistry for safe energy generation, biotechnology for new manufacturing methods, and sensors for forensic medical and environmental applications.
Students have the opportunity to engage with staff in research projects and this research-focused environment can enable students to develop practical expertise and apply theoretical knowledge to the role of chemistry in the modern world.

How You Study
Students have the opportunity to focus initially on organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry through an integrated approach that emphasises connectivity. Laboratory workshops and extensive use of specialist equipment provides the chance for students to develop hands-on skills. 
Later in the course, students can apply their experience to a range of real-world applications, including industry-informed, interdisciplinary projects. A significant research project also aims to develop students in a specialism of their choice. Throughout the course, there is an emphasis on developing the professional skills required for a future career in industry.

s policy is to ensure that staff return assessments to students promptly.", 'Accreditation
This course is accredited by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Through accreditation, the Royal Society of Chemistry aims to promote good practices in the university education of chemical scientists, and ensure that future practising scientists are knowledgeable and competent.
Skills Development and Professional Practice
Our Chemistry courses have an embedded explicit skills development programme through the professional practice modules. The programme delivers a systematic programme in skills development, which includes CV writing and interview skills. The modules exemplify the application of chemistry into key employment sectors and present chemistry through an integrated approach.
Industry Challenges
A series of themed industry challenges are co-delivered during the professional practice modules through industry partnerships with multi-national and SME organisations representing the analytical, formulation, pharmaceutical, and energy and environmental sectors.
After systematic project planning and management training, students can devise and present technical proposals in response to the challenge. After consultation and feedback from a joint academic and industry panel, students can execute project plans and report within industry standard methods. The professional practice modules aim to prepare students for placements and future employment.
I felt my student experience was enhanced by the support available from both my peers and the staff, who were always ready and willing to help in any way they could.

Placements
Students may have the opportunity to undertake placements during their degree. When students are on an optional placement in the UK or overseas or studying abroad, they will be required to cover their own transport and accommodation and meals costs.
Placements can range from a few weeks to a full year if students choose to undertake an optional sandwich year in industry (where available). Students are encouraged to obtain placements in industry independently. Tutors may provide support and advice to students who require it during this process.
What Can I Do with a Chemistry Degree?
Chemistry graduates may pursue a wide range of science-related careers in sectors including energy, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer and personal care products. This course aims to equip graduates with extensive analytical and mathematical skills which are relevant to roles in finance, management, science-based marketing and journalism, education, and academic research. Some graduates may choose to continue their studies at doctoral level.
