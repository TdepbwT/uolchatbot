Accreditation
Our BSc programme currently meets the educational requirements of the Chartered Mathematician designation. This is awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), when it is followed by subsequent training and experience in employment to obtain equivalent competences to those specified by the Quality Assurance Agency for taught Masters degrees. The MMath programme is accredited by the IMA.
Research-informed Teaching
Teaching on this course is conducted by academic members of staff who are active researchers in their fields. This research informs teaching at all levels of the programme. Staff conduct cutting-edge research in fundamental and applied mathematics and physics, ranging from pure mathematics to applied nano-science at the interface between biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The School of Mathematics and Physics collaborates with top research institutions in Germany, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the USA.
Visiting Speakers
The School of Mathematics and Physics regularly welcomes guest speakers from around the world. Recent visitors to the University of Lincoln have included former vice president of the Royal Astronomical Society Professor Don Kurtz, mathematician and author Professor Marcus du Sautoy OBE, and operations research specialist Ruth Kaufman OBE.
Studying Mathematics at Lincoln is a way to learn more about a subject that has many applications within the real world, whilst also learning about theoretical Mathematics. It has helped me to grow as a mathematician.
