Academic Years
This joint programme combines a foundation of pure and applied mathematics with the study of Philosophy, reflecting the complementary nature of these two disciplines to help explain our world and our place in it.
Mathematics with Philosophy at Lincoln combines two of the most fundamental and widely applicable intellectual skills. The course aims to provide students with the knowledge and ability to tackle quantifiable problems and to analyse issues and question assumptions. This enables them to develop their understanding of logic and reasoning.
Students have the opportunity to learn from, and work alongside, our team of academics who can support and encourage them to apply imagination, creativity, and rigour to the solution of real-world problems. Individual and group projects during the course are designed to develop transferable skills.

How You Study
Students can focus on numerical and analytical methods of mathematics, while developing a range of transferable skills, including logical reasoning, critical thinking, communication, and teamwork. This combination is intended to help students to develop the skills to tackle a variety of topics from different angles. It seeks to help students find answers and to evaluate the questions and reasoning behind them.
In the first year topics include algebra, calculus, ideas of mathematical proof, and an introduction to philosophical logic. In the second year students progress to differential equations, scientific computing, and the philosophy of science. The third year provides the opportunity for students to select from a range of optional modules to tailor the degree to their own interests.
The course is taught via lectures, problem solving classes, computer-based classes, and seminars.

Accreditation
Our BSc programme currently meets the educational requirements of the Chartered Mathematician designation. This is awarded by the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications (IMA), when it is followed by subsequent training and experience in employment to obtain equivalent competences to those specified by the Quality Assurance Agency for taught Masters degrees.
Research-informed Teaching
Teaching on this course is conducted by academic members of staff who are active researchers in their fields. This research informs teaching at all levels of the programme. Staff conduct cutting-edge research in fundamental and applied mathematics and physics, ranging from pure mathematics to applied nano-science at the interface between biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The School of Mathematics and Physics collaborates with top research institutions in Germany, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the USA.
Visiting Speakers
The School of Mathematics and Physics regularly welcomes guest speakers from around the world. Recent visitors to the University of Lincoln have included former vice president of the Royal Astronomical Society Professor Don Kurtz, mathematician and author Professor Marcus du Sautoy OBE, and operations research specialist Ruth Kaufman OBE.
Placements
Students on this course are encouraged to obtain and undertake work placements independently in the UK or overseas during their studies, providing hands-on experience in industry. These can range from a few weeks to a full year if students choose the sandwich year option. Placements may be conducted with external research institutions (which can be overseas). The option is subject to availability and selection criteria set by the industry or external institution. When undertaking optional placements, students will be required to cover their transport, accommodation, and general living costs.
