How You Study
Teaching on this programme reflects the research expertise of academic staff and enables students to tailor their learning in line with interests and career aspirations.
The first year of this course introduces students to core micro, macro and international economics. There are modules in econometric analysis that aim to help students develop expertise in the statistical techniques used to analyse and interpret economic data. 
Intermediate micro and macroeconomics are studied in the second year and are prerequisites for the advanced modules that are covered in year three. 
A range of optional modules are also available in the second and third years.
This course offers the option to take a year-long work placement after the second year of study. This provides the opportunity to gain experience and apply learning in practice. Students are expected to source their own placement, and tutors can provide support during the process if required. Those who choose to undertake a placement do not pay tuition fees for that year, but must cover their own travel, accommodation, and living costs.

Our BSc (Hons) Economics gives students the opportunity to develop the research, analytical, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills relevant to roles in market-focused areas such as forecasting, financial analysis, banking, insurance and accountancy. Opportunities can exist in management, as a professional economist, in government departments or financial services. Some students go on to postgraduate study.
The course built upon more complex ideas and introduced me to new and interesting fields within economics. All of the lecturers really care about the course and their students.
