How You Study
The first year introduces students to the core subjects that are fundamental to pharmaceutical science, such as chemistry, cell biology, human anatomy, and disease. Students can then progress to examining the analytical methods relevant to drug development, medicine delivery, immunology, pharmacology, and toxicology in the second year, where they will also explore key research techniques. The third year introduces more advanced subjects as well as the regulatory and ethical standards that apply to industry professionals.
There are also opportunities for students to take part in research alongside academics in order to develop their knowledge and experience, and enhance their skill set.
The course includes lectures, seminars, laboratory-based practical classes, and lectures from visiting scientists from the pharmaceutical industry.

Industry Placements and Visits
There may be opportunities to visit pharmaceutical companies and to learn from industrial scientists and leading experts through a programme of guest lectures. You may also have the opportunity to undertake placements. When you are on an optional placement in the UK or overseas or studying abroad, you will be required to cover your own transport, accommodation and general living costs. Placements can range from a few weeks to a full year if you choose to undertake an optional sandwich year in industry (where available). You are encouraged to obtain placements in industry independently. Tutors may provide support and advice to students who require it during this process.
The time I spent in the laboratory enhanced my research and manual skills in the areas of synthetic and analytical chemistry.
