How You Study
On this course, students can develop their knowledge, theory, and practice of sound and music production. This culminates in their own independent projects (two advanced pieces of client-based practice work), along with an extended piece of academic work in the form of a dissertation.

There will be opportunities for you to book our recording spaces for collaboration with students from film production, animation, journalism, and music.
In your second year, you can focus on your key areas of interest (post, radio, and/or music) through elective modules. Additionally, you will also prepare for your final-year dissertation through design of your major research project.
Your final year will enable you to bring together all of your previous creative, practical, and theoretical studies to produce two major client-based sound project portfolios, as well as complete your dissertation on your key area of interest.
For students who are interested in studying abroad, there may be the option to take part in an exchange programme in the USA. Please note that fees for the placement are included but travel, accommodation, and general living costs are the responsibility of the student.
