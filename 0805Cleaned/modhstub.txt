Modern History at Lincoln specialises in history from 1800 to the present day. This close focus offers the opportunity to better understand and navigate an increasingly socially, culturally, and politically complex world.
The BA (Hons) Modern History is distinctive both for its focus on modern history, and for the breadth of topics that students can choose to study. Students will have the opportunity to study British, European, American, and global history.
While Lincoln is well-known for its medieval cathedral, it also provides an excellent setting in which to study modern history. It is a vibrant city that has strong connections with histories of manufacturing, agriculture, and the Royal Air Force, and previous history students have contributed to the multi-million pound Bomber Command Centre.
The School of Humanities and Heritage has a strong research base in modern history with staff specialisms including gender, sexuality, race, media history, Chinese history, urban history, post-colonial history, material culture, American culture, and British politics.
