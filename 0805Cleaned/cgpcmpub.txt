The BSc (Hons) Games Computing programme at Lincoln aims to develop the skills and attributes required for roles in the competitive computing sector. The course is designed to help students develop as versatile professionals, capable of thriving in a wide range of post-university employment destinations. Students also have the opportunity to develop skills that lend themselves to the ever-growing, multi-billion pound video games industry.
The course aims to develop a skillset that is applicable to the wider spectrum of the digital sector. Beyond learning how to develop software, students can also develop an understanding of the interaction between the computer and its user, and how to design an engaging experience. We aim to produce graduates who can adapt to quickly evolving technology and play key roles within the companies at the forefront of those advances. Beyond how to develop technology, a games computing student can also gain an understanding of how to make it engaging, playful, and fun.
The course explores computer science through the specific use-case of games. Students have the opportunity to develop programming skills, alongside specialist modules in topics including games design, 3D graphics, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence.
