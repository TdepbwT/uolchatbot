How You Study
Business Economics combines the study of economics with a wide variety of business and finance-related topics. In the first year, students can gain a solid grounding in economics, marketing, business finance, and law. This is built on in the second year, with topics including fundamental econometrics, and competition and regulation. Industries and firms are examined from an economic perspective.
During the final year, students are able to choose optional modules in finance and economics, enabling them to tailor the degree to match their individual interests and career aspirations. They have the opportunity to undertake a substantive independent research project on a topic of their choice, with guidance from their academic supervisor.
