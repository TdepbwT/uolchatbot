Academic Years
The scientific study of animal behaviour and welfare furthers our understanding of why animals behave in the way that they do, and helps us learn how best to respond to the challenges that animals face when living in captive and wild environments.
This degree employs a multi-disciplinary, research-driven approach to the study of animal behaviour and welfare. The course aims to help students develop the knowledge and skills needed to understand animal behaviour and welfare, working, for example, with insects, reptiles, birds, and mammals.
It is informed by academics who are considered to be at the forefront of their respective fields in welfare assessment, animal management, evolutionary biology, and animal cognition. This includes leading experts Professor Daniel Mills, who specialises in clinical animal behaviour; Professor Anna Wilkinson, who specialises in animal cognition; and Professor Oliver Burman, who specialises in assessment of animal welfare.

How You Study
In the first year, students can develop a solid foundation in animal anatomy and physiology, cell biology, genetics, captive animal management, and animal behaviour.
These themes are developed further in the second year through the study of specialist subjects dealing with animal behaviour, health, and disease. In the final year, core modules focus on pure and applied aspects of animal behaviour and welfare. Students also undertake a supervised, independent research project.

BSc (Hons) Animal Behaviour and Welfare
Informed by Research
This course is informed by academics who are considered to be at the forefront of their respective fields in welfare assessment, animal management, evolutionary biology, and animal cognition. These include Professor Daniel Mills, Professor Anna Wilkinson, Professor Oliver Burman, and Dr Jonathan Cooper.
Our research work is read widely by the scientific community as well as informing the Government, animal welfare sector, and animal industry regarding animal protection. Research projects have included leading work with cats, dogs, rabbits, horses, reptiles, and parrots, both at the University of Lincoln and working with research partners. Students at Lincoln have conducted project work on a wide range of zoo based species in partnership with local zoos, including polar bears, hunting dogs, tigers, meerkats, and primates.As well as informing teaching by providing deeper understanding of how animals see the world, our engagement with animal welfare research and legislation provides insights into how to bring about meaningful, scientifically valid improvements in animal protection and the practical and effective management of animals in our care.
What Can I Do with a Animal Behaviour and Welfare Degree?
Graduates have gone on to work in both practical and research roles that involve the management, welfare, training, and conservation of companion, farm, and wild animals. Some graduates choose to continue their studies at Masters or PhD level at the University of Lincoln, including our MSc in Clinical Animal Behaviour.
I have recently accepted a job offer as an animal trainer at Mars Petcare. I was able to use practical sessions and assignments from modules as examples in my interview.
