Philosophers search for knowledge and truth, exploring the fundamental nature of reality and some of the most important questions about the world around us such as what is the self? What is a just society? Is free will an illusion? And, does God exist?
The Philosophy degree at Lincoln offers students the opportunity to study these questions and others through the lens of cutting-edge contemporary philosophical research, as well as the writings of the great philosophers, such as Plato, Descartes, Nietzsche, Marx, and Wittgenstein. 
The course makes high intellectual demands of students, and aims to develop the ability to think clearly, to construct and defend arguments, and be willing to explore a range of approaches to different topics.

Students can develop valuable skills in reasoning, analysis, creative problem solving, and communication, which are relevant for a wide range of careers.
Over the duration of the programme, students are expected to develop an understanding of all the major fields in contemporary philosophy, including ethics, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, epistemology, logic, philosophy of religion, philosophy of science, existentialism, legal and political philosophy, animal ethics, philosophy of love and sex, Indian philosophy, and philosophy of psychiatry and mental illness. Students are also introduced to major figures in the history of philosophy, such as Students are also introduced to major figures in the history of philosophy, such as Plato, Aristotle, Nagarjuna, Descartes, Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Sartre, and Simone De Beauvoir. Studying original texts from great minds both past and present can help students learn to form, develop, and defend their own answers.
Students will explore these areas using the philosophical method of logical analysis and reasoned argument, and from the outset will be encouraged to develop their own views, and to critically assess the views of others. 
As Philosophy will be a new subject for many students, the first year of the degree offers a chance to study a wide range of modules, with increasing specialisation in years two and three. The course is mainly delivered through a series of lectures and seminars. Each module usually consists of lectures in which topics are introduced and key concepts and ideas are examined and explained. Lectures also introduce the reading required for seminars.
Seminars are used to support lectures and are an opportunity for students to meet with a tutor in smaller groups and discuss the philosophical topic under consideration in greater depth. Occasionally workshops are used to work through a particular issue, question, or topic.

Lincoln is home to the Lincoln Philosophy Salon, which holds monthly talks in a local pub from world-leading professional philosophers. This is a thriving organisation with a membership of around 600 people, which provides a great opportunity for students to interact socially with staff and to discuss cutting-edge ideas with some of the most important living philosophers working today.In addition, the Undergraduate Philosophy Society, which is run by students, organises talks and social events for students interested in Philosophy. We also hold an annual philosophy lecture, bringing a philosopher of international standing to Lincoln to give a talk on a topic of their choosing.

At the heart of student life is our library which will provide you with access to more than 260,000 journals and 750,000 print and electronic books, as well as databases and specialist collections.
Learning Lounges
You can also take advantage of our range of modern study areas located across campus, including learning lounges which give you the opportunity to study alone or with your friends and coursemates
Study Abroad
Students within the School of Humanities and Heritage have the opportunity to spend a term studying at one of the Universitys partner institutions in North America or Europe. Students will be expected to cover their own transport, accommodation, and living costs while studying abroad, and places are allocated competitively, subject to academic criteria.
The thing that has stuck with me most from the course is that we are being taught to be philosophers rather than simply remembering what others have said.
