How You Study
Conservation is a multidisciplinary course, drawing together skills in art, science and history, and applying these to cultural heritage. This course aims to offer a balance between learning both the theory and practice of conservation. This enables you to navigate decision-making and ethics through independent research and the guidance of tutors.
Throughout the course, you can carry out conservation treatments and scientific analysis of historical artefacts. This starts with simple objects in the first year and becomes more complex as your skills and knowledge increase. The course culminates in an exhibition of work at the end of the final year, celebrating the achievements of the graduating group with their family and friends, as well as potential employers.
The second term of year two offers the opportunity to study overseas at a partner institution, choose from a range of optional modules from across the Lincoln School of Humanities and Heritage, or undertake an extended work placement. You have the opportunity to source your own placement in a historic property, museum, or private workshop in the UK, or overseas.
The course is taught through a combination of lectures and practicals. After an initial introduction to conservation skills, materials and techniques, you will carry out practical work on historic objects from museums and private collections.
