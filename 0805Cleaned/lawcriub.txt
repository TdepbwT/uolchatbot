Students are encouraged to gain as much experience as possible during the degree. They can develop their practical legal skills in the Universitys moot court, and by entering competitions in mooting and negotiation. There is a University pro bono Law Clinic, where students have the opportunity to give legal advice to real people, under supervision.
The course provided me with an excellent understanding of the theory and practice that underpins many of the agencies within the criminal justice system and helped me to develop the skills required to be an academic.
