s digital society, and develop critical and creative skills relevant to this new world. ", 'Media studies has never been more relevant or stimulating. Digital, networked media now form a ubiquitous and inextricable part of our everyday lives, holding an unprecedented power to drive opinions, debates, and movements. We live, work, play, and communicate with each other in a world saturated by media.
This programme engages critically and speculatively with the full depth and breadth of 21st Century media. This includes everyday devices like smartphones and computers (and the various platforms accessible by them, including social media and games), through to more traditional media such as film and television (and the ways in which they have been transformed by digital processes like streaming). 
Today, these technologies are so entangled with our economic, social, cultural, psychological, technical, and environmental realms that basic skills now include not only reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also knowledge of, and competency in, media and communication.
The Lincoln School of Film, Media and Journalism is home to a creative community of ambitious students, experienced staff and researchers, and inspiring visiting speakers.
