How You Study
In the first year, students are encouraged to work in both traditional and digital media while studying the fundamental principles of graphic design. The course introduces the creative methods needed in the industry to answer briefs, solve communication problems, and meet deadlines, alongside a theory course that underpins the social context and history of the subject. 
This knowledge is taken further in the second year, where more advanced concepts of graphic design are introduced. The third year provides an opportunity for students to develop their own specialism with a range of projects to choose from, including projects set by industry. The third year culminates in a physical or online end-of-year degree show.
During the three years of the course, students are encouraged to undertake competition briefs or apply to recognised industry award schemes. The course has an impressive track record of success with the YCN Awards, British Book Design & Publication Awards, the RSA Student Design Awards, Adobe Top Talent Awards, and many others. Depending on the award scheme, these offer opportunities for networking, industry recognition, placements and bursaries.
As the course progresses, students will develop a professional portfolio of work through a mixture of studio projects and independent, collaborative, and industry-led briefs.
Studio practice is a key element of this course, and students will have the opportunity to spend a lot of time in creative studio environments. Teaching and learning experiences may include online and studio activities, peer groups, lectures, workshops, seminars, and group tutorials. Students can also benefit from one-to-one tutorials, portfolio reviews, and self-initiated work experience.
