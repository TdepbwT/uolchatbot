Academic Years
Forensic chemistry is the application of scientific knowledge and investigation to law enforcement. From identifying substances to analysing crime scenes, the skills of a forensic chemist often play a vital role in criminal investigations.
The course provides students with the opportunity to develop the skills of a professional forensic chemist, including laboratory examination, report writing, crime scene analysis and courtroom presentation. With a broad spectrum of modules, it is possible to specialise in areas such as DNA analysis, biological chemistry, or nuclear forensics.
The School of Chemistry takes a research-centred approach to teaching and learning, and students have the chance to work closely with leading academics on collaborative research projects.

How You Study
The first year offers a solid foundation in chemistry, including laboratory work and mathematics and statistics, as well as the principles of forensic science and crime scene investigation. In their second year, students go on to explore advanced aspects of forensic chemistry and are introduced to key areas of advanced crime scene methods and trace evidence, before tailoring the course to match their interests with a range of modules in their third year.
The course includes lectures, seminars, laboratory-based practical classes, and lectures from visiting scientists.

Accreditation
This course is accredited by the Royal Society of Chemistry. Through accreditation, the Royal Society of Chemistry aims to promote good practices in the university education of chemical scientists, and ensure that future practising scientists are knowledgeable and competent.
Skills Development and Professional Practice
Our Chemistry courses have an embedded explicit skills development programme through the professional practice modules. The programme delivers a systematic programme in skills development, which includes CV writing and interview skills. The modules exemplify the application of chemistry into key employment sectors and present chemistry through an integrated approach.
Industry Challenges
A series of themed industry challenges are co-delivered during the professional practice modules through industry partnerships with multi-national and SME organisations representing the analytical, formulation, pharmaceutical, and energy and environmental sectors.
After systematic project planning and management training, students can devise and present technical proposals in response to the challenge. After consultation and feedback from a joint academic and industry panel, students can execute project plans and report within industry standard methods. The professional practice modules aim to prepare students for placements and future employment.
If it wasnt for the University of Lincoln, I would not be working for one of the best global pharmaceutical companies in the world.

Placements
Students may have the opportunity to undertake placements during their degree. When students are on an optional placement in the UK or overseas or studying abroad, they will be required to cover their own transport and accommodation and meals costs.
Placements can range from a few weeks to a full year if students choose to undertake an optional sandwich year in industry (where available). Students are encouraged to obtain placements in industry independently. Tutors may provide support and advice to students who require it during this process.
What Can I Do with a Forensic Chemistry Degree?
Forensic Chemistry graduates benefit from specialist skills and technical knowledge that are transferable to careers in chemistry, forensic laboratories, and law enforcement organisations, such as police forces, HMRC, and environmental health. Some graduates go on to study at postgraduate level.
