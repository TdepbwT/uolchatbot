Education professionals make a difference to the lives of children and young people, inspiring them to learn and developing their knowledge and skills to prepare them for their future.
The BSc (Hons) Education and Psychology degree looks at the way in which children and young people develop and learn. It uses the application of psychology to support a broader understanding of education, enabling students to gain an insight into the ways in which learning is shaped and delivered.
Students at Lincoln can gain an insight into the ways in which learning is shaped and delivered through a course which explores how psychological theory can be related to a variety of educational environments, as well as considering a range of psychological issues.
Research based learning is an important part of this course and students will be encouraged to use enquiry and investigative approaches to learn more about education and psychology throughout their three-year study.

How You Study
Learning and teaching are explored through four areas: philosophy, sociology, history, and psychology - with a strong focus on how psychology can support a broad understanding of education. Education systems in compulsory schools and other learning environments can also be examined throughout the degree. Students can also develop and refine their research skills and can begin to tailor their course to their interests by choosing optional modules in their second and third years.Teaching takes place in lectures, seminars and workshops, and in small groups, depending on the level and the topic of study. In addition, staff use the intranet to provide materials to support teaching; course materials are posted to an online virtual learning environment to supplement face to face teaching and support onsite and remote study.

How you are assessed
The aim of module assessments are to provide a measure of the development and attainment of course outcomes, including the attainment of high-level intellectual skills such as critical analysis and evaluation.
Accordingly, the nature of assessment varies across the three levels of the course. Assessments at levels one and two focus on the acquisition and understanding of knowledge and skills. In contrast, the level three assessments place far greater emphasis on the ability to apply, analyse, and evaluate knowledge.
