Research
Our School aims to produce critical thinkers and independent researchers who are able to tackle psychological problems and issues using a systematic, critical, and analytical approach.
As part of this process, first year students undertake training in areas important to psychological research, such as using statistics software. In the second year, students may be able to utilise these skills by working alongside an academic supervisor to conduct an original research project. This culminates with students being able to undertake a substantial research study of their own for the dissertation component of their degree.
In addition to the taught components of research, students are encouraged to participate in the research culture of the School more broadly, with the opportunity to be involved as volunteers in research activities, such as our Summer Scientist programme, and to compete for paid studentships offered by the University of Lincoln and the British Psychological Society to conduct further research over the summer, typically in between the second and third year of the course.
We also have a number of active research groups within the school. These are conducting exciting research into areas such as developmental, cognitive, social, forensic, and psychological health within the school, and you can read more on our Research webpage. The School of Psychology also shares close working links with the School of Sport and Exercise Science, and contributes to various sport and psychology research.

Our range of specialist researchlaboratoriesallow you to gain practical experience. You will also have access to ICT suites and technical staff who can offer support in the design and execution of experiments and assistance with specialist software.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) Laboratory
The EEG lab allows our researchers to identify activation patterns in the cerebrum, in response to stimuli, to find out when and which parts of the brain respond to these. 
Eye-tracking Laboratory
Research in this lab investigates how visual cognition is shaped and influenced by our environment, experience and knowledge. Current research is examining how visual cues are processed in the brain.
Lincoln Infant and Child Development Laboratory
Research here categorises conceptual development including speech perception, language acquisition - particularly word learning and grammar. 
Molecular Laboratory
The Molecular laboratory houses a contained wet lab for chemical and biological analyses on site and stores samples from participants before, during, and after processing and analysis.
Sleep Laboratory
This dedicated facility conducts full polysomnography, actigraphy, home sleep monitoring, and computerised behavioural testing in the areas of neuroscience, sleep, and wellbeing.
What Can I Do with a Psychology (Sport and Exercise Psychology) Degree?
This programme provides Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership of the British Psychological Society (BPS). As a graduate, you can consider further professional training within various fields of psychology, such as clinical, health, sport and exercise, counselling, occupational, educational, forensic, neuropsychology, and academic research or teaching. Other graduates may wish to progress to study at postgraduate level. Specifically, sport and exercise psychologists help athletes improve their performance. In most sport psychology careers, you may work with athletes regarding motivation, stress management, effective teamwork, and other psychological factors affecting their athletic performance.
Since graduating I have worked in clinical psychology as an assistant psychologist, during which I utilised the research, analysis and report writing skills learned in my time at Lincoln.
