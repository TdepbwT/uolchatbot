Lincolns School of Psychology gave me the most wonderful three years and I learnt far more than I ever expected to. I found new loves for topics and subjects I hadnt thought of during my A-level Psychology studies, and studying Psychology at Lincoln gave me a clear direction of what I wanted to do after I graduated.
