Learn From Experts
Research is essential in informing our teaching and each of our academics is passionate about research. The College of Health and Science hosts the Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health (LCWPH), and the Development, Inequality, Resilience and Environments (DIRE), Lincoln Climate, and Catchments and Coasts (CCRG) research groups.
Our students have the chance to encounter authentic research at all levels either through their own activities or through the teaching staff sharing experiences from their own research. Wider opportunities to engage in research are provided through guest lectures within the course, working closely with the Lincoln branch of the Geographical Association externally, and engaging in research projects with staff. Two students have already completed UROS projects with the Department of Geography.
Explore Our Expertise
Geography is an ideal subject to study for understanding how to address major environmental and social challenges such as the climate crisis, and also for picking up vital work skills.
