By building links with the Year 1 curriculum, students are prepared for the transition to the next level of their degree programme. Teaching is through seminars and practical sessions, with a mixture of theory and work in the computer laboratory. The module is assessed by a coursework portfolio, in which students solve problems and respond to scenarios set by the teaching staff.
Foundation Year Engineering (Robotics Students)
This module aims to enable students to gain an understanding of their chosen degree and career path, as well as supporting them in their personal development as reflective learners and engineers. Shaped around a series of practical activities, the aim is for students to explore current and future developments in engineering and the engineering industry. Practical activities are aligned to various engineering disciplines, such as automation, electrical and electronics, control, and mechanical engineering, in order to provide an insight into the diverse range of opportunities within the profession and the aim is to enable students to make an informed choice on study pathways.
How You Are Assessed
The way students will be assessed will vary for each module. It could include coursework, such as a lab report or essay, an end of year synoptic assessment, portfolio development, group work, or presentations to name some examples.
