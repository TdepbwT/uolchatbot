Research-informed Teaching
Teaching on this course is conducted by academic members of staff who are active researchers in their fields. This research informs teaching at all levels of the programme. Staff conduct cutting-edge research in fundamental and applied mathematics and physics, ranging from pure mathematics to applied nano-science at the interface between biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The School of Mathematics and Physics collaborates with top research institutions in Germany, Japan, Norway, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, and the USA.
Visiting Speakers
The School of Mathematics and Physics regularly welcomes guest speakers from around the world. Recent visitors to the University of Lincoln have included former vice president of the Royal Astronomical Society Professor Don Kurtz, mathematician and author Professor Marcus du Sautoy OBE, and operations research specialist Ruth Kaufman OBE.
Field Trip
Students on this course can take part in an optional field trip. Destinations may vary, but have previously included the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory at La Palma in the Canary Islands. The Roque de los Muchachos Observatory is home to an impressive collection of astronomical facilities, including the worlds largest optical single aperture telescope. The field trip will be partially funded by the School, however students will be required to make a contribution to costs.
Placements
Students on this course are encouraged to obtain and undertake work placements independently in the UK or overseas during their studies, providing hands-on experience in industry. These can range from a few weeks to a full year if students choose the sandwich year option. Placements may be conducted with external research institutions (which can be overseas). The option is subject to availability and selection criteria set by the industry or external institution. When undertaking optional placements, students will be required to cover their transport, accommodation, and general living costs.
What Can I Do with a Physics with Astrophysics Degree?
A Physics with Astrophysics degree is designed to equip graduates with the skills needed to work in the space industry. Physics with Astrophysics graduates are also well placed for careers in research and development, process control, finance, software development and regulatory roles in organisations around the world. Some may go on to perform roles in education or further study at postgraduate level. Additionally, transferable skills related to communication, problem-solving, and decision-making, which students are expected to develop throughout their studies, are valuable in many spheres of employment.
