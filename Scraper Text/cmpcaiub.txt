Academic Years
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an exciting and wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. There is a growing requirement and reliance on computer science and artificial intelligence in modern organisations around the world in areas such as data analysis and behavioural patterns, as well as technologies such as home assistants, mobile platforms, and transportation.
Our BSc (Hons) Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence programme aims to develop confident and informed graduates who will be able to contribute to and develop these and new technologies of the future. The artificial intelligence theme will focus upon developing knowledge and practice in highly relevant areas such as natural language processing; nature inspired computing; deep learning and its applications; and the ethics of artificial intelligence systems.

How You Study
In the first year, students have the opportunity to study the fundamental areas of computer science. This includes operating systems, maths for computing, data science, and computer architectures.
The second year aims to build on this foundation, covering artificial intelligence, natural language processing, database systems and networking, with industry certification opportunities available to students for topics such as database systems, networking, and software development. Students will also have the opportunity to work on a group project in the Team Software Engineering module.
In the third year, students study topics such as machine learning, deep learning, big data, and autonomous mobile robotics. Third-year students will also be expected to undertake a substantial individual project on a topic of interest.
Modules
 Some courses may offer optional modules. The availability of optional modules may vary from year to year and will be subject to minimum student numbers being achieved. This means that the availability of specific optional modules cannot be guaranteed. Optional module selection may also be affected by staff availability.
