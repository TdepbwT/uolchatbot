We highly value the ethos of student as producer and aspire to support our students to develop their own independent line of enquiry that captures their interests and upholds the values of our research group: the situation is DIRE. Our postgraduate students are actively working to address issues related to development, inequalities, building resilience, and sustainable environments.

 A tale of two cities: understanding the perceptions and barriers to tackling the UK Housing Crisis in Lincoln and Doncaster
For the best part of two decades, the UK has underdelivered on building new housing. The UK now needs an additional 345,000 new homes each year, to accommodate its growing population. Consequently, house prices have increased by 44% since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and are continuing to rise. Housing is a fundamental component of social mobility and economic security, yet the UK has persistently struggled to develop the required amount to new housing to support population growth.
NIMBYism (Not-In-My-Back-Yard-ism) is believed to have influenced political resistance to develop new housing in the regions that need it most. This research aims to identify the underlying factors that influence NIMBY attitudes in the UK, and how factors vary between groups by age, gender, education, income, and region.
Understanding NIMBY attitudes will allow planning specialists, urban developers, and government to address barriers to building new housing to help ease the national Housing Crisis. The research considers how attitudes might vary between two cities in both Lincoln, in the East Midlands and Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with the aim to identify factors that might vary spatially. Easing this crisis is necessary to improve social mobility, economic conditions and help lift a generation of young people out of the renting framework and into home ownership.

Evaluating the relationship between urbanisation and dengue fever in Malaysia -Grace Atkin
Without thorough understanding, the distribution and control of infectious diseases can be hard to manage. One of particular importance is dengue fever which affects millions of people annually. Although dengue fever is not life-threatening, it can potentially turn into a severe, fatal form known as dengue haemorrhagic fever which highlights the requirement to raise awareness to mitigate transmission.
The disease has become further distributed across the globe with increased connectivity through transport and technology, particularly in subtropical and tropical regions such as South East Asia. Furthermore, in developing countries such as Malaysia, an increase in urbanisation processes has provided ideal conditions for the vectors to thrive. This study aims to shed light on the relationship between dengue incidence and the role of urban and semi-urban areas in Malaysia. However, the study also considers other contributing factors such as climate influences and the role of governance and how these further impact management interventions. Although previous studies have examined the relationship between urbanisation and the prevalence of disease, there is an absence of country-specific, case study accounts which include an analysis of management strategies. This research involves a qualitative analysis of research literature, official government documents and semi-structured interviews alongside quantitative methods examining case numbers, demographic characteristics, and environmental statistics. This combination provides a thorough insight into the reality of Malaysias experiences with dengue fever throughout the past two decades.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Formal and Non-Formal Environmental Stewardship- Soseala Tinilau
Tuvalu and other Pacific island nations rely on biodiversity and ecosystem services, both of which are threatened by climate change. A critical impediment to strengthening national resilient development has been identified as a lack of capacity and competence as a result of the lack of sustainable approved and quality-assured formal training programs at the vocational level. As a result of the aforementioned roadblocks, this study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of formal and non-formal environmental stewardship training and developing and testing an acceptable approach for examining educational interventions on environmental stewardship.
s conclusion.", 'Tuvalus climate change resilience and environmental stewardship education are expected to increase as a result of the study. Donors and assistance agencies will benefit from the studys recommendations for adequate training and accreditation to improve environmental stewardship. The study will also provide fresh theoretical insights into how developing country climate pedagogy is managed.

Examining the Public Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic in the UK-Olivia Whyte
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the global spread of the 2019 novel Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has arguably impacted people across the globe like no other event of the 21stCentury. While efforts to curb the rise of cases and deaths have been implemented, such as the rollout of vaccinations, the actions of individuals are also significant in limiting the risk and spread of the virus.
This research aims to explore individual behaviour during the Covid-19 pandemic and explore factors that influence the behaviours of the UK public. The behaviours being investigated include the use of face coverings and abidance to social distancing, household mixing, and self-isolation rules imposed by the government across different time periods of the pandemic.
Additionally, there are a number of competing factors/theories which may motivate behaviours during a pandemic, including cognitive factors, such as psychological closeness, moral responsibility, social norms, risk, knowledge and trust, as well as practical considerations, including legal compliance and policy. Therefore, this research aims to identify the main factors and associated theories which explain the behaviours of the UK public. The methodology of this research takes a mixed-methods approach, and the data was collected through an online survey that gained 203 participants over the course of three months. The results of this research will be derived from statistical and thematic analysis.

Ecosystem Dynamics | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health aims to understand ecosystem dynamics using a variety of techniques for spatial and temporal scale reconstructions to determine global patterns, ecological response, long-term change, and ecosystem function.
Lake Aquatic Ecosystems: Climate Driven Dynamics
We are interested in understanding long-term climate driven relationships between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems through high-resolution multi-proxy palaeoecological data.
Lake Aquatic Ecosystems: Hydrodynamics of Large Lakes
LCWPH has used a three-dimensional thermo hydrodynamic model, Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC), to model the thermal behaviour of Lake Ontario (springwarming, thermal bar formation, and summer stratification). The aim is to understand how climatic changes influence the thermal bar that directly effects the fish habitats and near shore ecosystem.
Global Vegetation Dynamics
We are using satellite derived parameters related to vegetation to detect stresses related to water and contaminants.
Fish Habitats
The extent to which environmental context mediates the bioaccumulation of biotransported contaminants by stream resident organisms is poorly understood. Our results highlight that contaminant transport by a migratory organism can have substantial consequences for recipient ecosystems. We are interested in modelling fish habitats in large lakes.
Fire Disturbance
We are interested in studying the impact of fire disturbance on ecosystem response and dynamics of on terrestrial and aquatic environments.
Floodplain Ecosystems
Riverine flood plains are among the worlds most threatened ecosystems. We are currently looking at vegetation changes over the past 30 years along the contaminated river corridors.

Inequality | DIRE | University of LincolnInequality
Relationships between social disadvantage and socio-economic outcomes are well documented in some many parts of the world but less is known about unfair and uneven development over space and time in most countries. The Inequalities cluster encourages both critically engaged technical work and technically capable critical work. Our work embraces quantitative and qualitative social research practice to provide clarity about the best routes for understanding and tackling inequalities through an interdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective. Our current projects include exploring the factors that explain inequality and the impact on vulnerability, particularly in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic. DIRE members in the School of Geography and School of Health and Social Care are engaged in ongoing real-time research about how demographic and socio-economic inequalities increased the vulnerability of some groups in society to biological contagion and acute mental health conditions during the pandemic. Other areas of research include how socio-economic inequalities in coastal communities in developed and developing countries are reflected in policy-making, particularly in relation to planning and management responses to biodiversity loss and sea level rise.
Dr Cliftons research has explored how power and organisation amongst stakeholder groups influences values and decision-making with regards to marine resource management in Australia. This research has demonstrated a significant conservation ethic amongst older and more affluent recreational fishers. This influences views on the implementation of new marine protected areas whilst also affecting the extent to which fishing pressure can be alleviated by artificial reefs. This research has been extended to consider how individual and collective social values interact around artificial reefs and the implications for their future expansion in the context of oil and gas rig decommissioning.

Waterborne and Vector-borne Disease | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
In recent years, waterborne and vector-borne parasitic and bacterial diseases have emerged orre-emerged in many geographical regions, causing global health and economic problems. The ecology andepidemiology of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are affected by the interrelations betweenthree main factors comprising the pathogen, the host, and the environment. Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Healthresearchers areinterested in the potential impact of diseases on human health.

Historical reconstruction of epidemic disease is important because it allows us to test the key factors associated with its spread, severity, and varying degrees of human susceptibility. Epidemic disease was reconstructed from parish registers of burials, particularly in areas where there was systematic recording of mortality in England. LCWPH researchers are interested in exploring the role of extreme weather events and climatic change in the outbreak, spread, and severity of epidemics.
Spatial Agent-Based Modelling of Malaria (ABM)
Understanding a landscape epidemiology system requires more than an understanding of the different types of individuals (host, vector, and pathogen) that comprise the system. It alsorequires understanding how the individuals interact with each other and with the environment. Twomosquito-control interventions were modelled using GIS and an ABM for a study site in Kenya. LCWPH researchers are interested in integrating data from social media and apps to create a dynamic ABM model.

Coasts and Catchments | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
Coastal erosion and coastal flooding range are among the most severe concerns of coastal communities. In the future, sea-level rise (SLR) increases the risk of loss of land, assets, and lives. The resilience of coastal systems to SLR, to a large extent, is controlled by coastal sediment availability, being heavily impacted by climate change and anthropogenic modifications in the river catchments.Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health integrates riverine and coastal research to unravel the interactions and feedback mechanisms between coasts and catchments to better understand the resilience of natural and social coastal systems.
River Catchments
Sediment delivery in river catchments is reduced by an increasing number of river dams for water supply and energy production. Meanwhile, ongoing land use changes (e.g. deforestation) may increase riverine sediment delivery into the coastal zone.
Coastal Ecosystems
Where sufficient sediment is available, coastal ecosystems may establish and facilitate land building and land raising through vertical sediment accretion.
Deltas and Estuaries
Marine and riverine forces shape the morphology of river mouth systems, such as deltas and estuaries. Deltas and estuaries are global population hotspots at risk from riverine, coastal and compound flooding events as well as coastal erosion.
Ecosystem-based Adaptation
Coastal ecosystems are increasingly acknowledged as natural coastal defences, which are ecologically valuable and self-adapting tosea-level rise.

River Science | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
Rivers satisfy multiple social needs in terms of resources and services. Yet, they are affected by a wide degree of human impacts, which reduce the environmental and societal services that rivers provide, and are often in need of restoration.Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health is committed to tackling these issues in the interdisciplinary framework of River Science, which stands at the interface of geomorphology, ecology, engineering, and social sciences. Sustainable river management requires a paradigm that considers social-eco-hydro-morphological processes and feedbacks determining river functioning.
Sediment Process and Morphodynamics
Our aim is to characterise the complex relationships between sediment sources at the basin scale, connectivity, sediment fluxes, and river morphodynamics, and to quantify the impact of human interventions on fluvial dynamics.
Ecological Functioning of Riverine Ecosystems
Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Healthaims to characterise the biodiversity of rivers and to understand how fluvial processes affect and are affected by fauna and flora at multiple scales.
Rivers and Society
Our research aims to determine human perceptions and aesthetic preferences towards several natural and artificial elements related to river systems, in order to understand the role of rivers in the collective identities of communities.
Rivers and Natural Hazards
LCWPH is working to develop a series of robust and practical tools for analysing flood hazards and risks associated also with vegetation and large wood in rivers.
Rivers and Energy
Rivers are a source of energy. In many countries the challenge is to rank potential sites for future developments considering ecological values and services.
Floodplain Sedimentary Archives
We aim to reconstruct multi-centennial length flood histories and undertake long-term flood frequency analysis by incorporating historical and palaeoflood data into flood series, and considering climate and land-use changes and the modification of channel capacity.

Rural Visions | Research | University of LincolnRural Visions is a collaboration of researchers at the University of Lincoln embracing an eclectic range of expertise spanning rural economics, community development, landscape histories, demography, animals and nature, environmental issues, rural poverty and the impacts of technology. Our work is focused on improving understanding of rural places and informing action to enhance lives in rural places.
Our Visions
Economic Visions
Rural economies are evolving thanks to new migration flows, new technologies and enhanced urban-rural connectivity. New opportunities created by visionary entrepreneurs and innovators are essential to sustain the vitality of rural places.
Aesthetic Visions
Rural landscapes and rural built environments are often cherished as part of a national identity, especially in the UK. The idyllic rural visions that are portrayed, however, do not reflect all types of rurality, so a critical understanding of the power of rural representations and imagery is essential to inform rural research.
Policy Visions
This theme of our research is about creating a vision for the future of rural places. How can government at different scales design and implement policies that will move towards a vision of a more sustainable rural future that addresses multiple demographic, climatic, technological and cultural threats to contemporary rural life?
Projects
Releasing the Potential of Your Rural Economy
The University of Lincoln Schools of Geography and Business have teamed up with Roger Turner of Rural Enterprise UK (Newcastle University) to launch a guide for economic policy-makers to ensure that rural areas are properly recognised within new Local Industrial Strategies.
For further information contact Gary Bosworth or Liz Price.

Saline Farming (SalFar)
SalFar is addressing threats to conventional agriculture deriving from increases in soil salinity. Increased coastal flooding and summer droughts are just two features of climate change that are impacting soil salinity. SalFar will carry our crop trials in a number of EU countries, including here in Lincolnshire, as part of a project assessing the wider market potential for salt-tolerant varieties and innovative halophytic crops.
Staff involved: Gary Bosworth, Iain Gould, Mark Macklin, Simon Pearson, Marian Rizov, Eric Ruto, Domna Tzemi, Isobel Wright.

Lincolnshire Beekeeping Survey
The importance of bees for the nations food security is well known. The importance of beekeepers, however, receives less attention. This survey seeks to understand more about the people who keep bees and their motivations  are they just hobbyists, are they environmentalists or are they business people? With this knowledge, policy designed to support bee populations can more effectively engage beekeepers leading to better implementation.
For further information contact Gary Bosworth or Will Hamilton.

Health and Wellbeing Among UK Farmers
Members of Rural Visions have recently carried out a study highlighting some of the challenges faced by farmers and other agricultural workers. Their findings indicate that increased stress and poor health can arise from combinations of farm-level and community factors interacting with economic and technological changes.
Health and Wellbeing Research Report

Resilience | DIRE | University of LincolnResilience
The resilience cluster engages critically with the idea and concept of societal resilience and the cognate ideas of vulnerability and adaptation. It focusses especially on the theme of disasters and climate change, their causes and responses, as well as the social, economic, political and behavioural factors that promote - or hinder - resilient communities and citizens. These themes are addressed at a range of geographical scales including the subcontinent, the nation state, the region, and the municipality. Research on resilience also links historical and contemporary research by providing long-term perspectives on problems that are often assumed to be of modern origin.
Featured Research
Dr Kythreotis recently completed publishing on a Regional Studies Association funded project entitled The spatial integration of climate change adaptation governance in the UK: the efficacy of a (city-) regional politics? This research unpacked the way in which climate adaptation and resilience policy and governance in the UK is embedded within the notion of the spatial, particularly the city-region.

Environmental Contamination | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health researches contamination atbasin,catchment to global scale, arising from past and present mining, agriculture, urban developments, and industry. We aim to develop new approaches to risk management and sustainable development.
Mining and Contaminant Metals
Mining underpins the global economy but can have negative impacts on the environment and aquatic ecosystems. We are usinga suite of high-resolution global datasets along with remote sensing/Geographical Information System (GIS) techniques to study the environmental impacts of metal mining and tailings dam failures on river systems worldwide.
Geological Contamination
s provisional limit of 10ppb. At this concentration the water will increase the risk of cancer and other serious illnesses. We are studying how river-groundwater interaction drives this problem and blights lives.", 'Emerging Contaminants
Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) include pesticides, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals, that accumulate in natural waters and sediments. Thesecan damage ecosystem and human health including by transporting anti-microbial resistance viarivers. We are studying the effects of this in the UK through a PhD studentship and the problems inthe Ganga (India) in a Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF) project. Through this research we hope to understand the scale of thecrisis and develop mitigation strategies.
Agricultural Contamination
Surplus nutrients (nitrates, phosphates & silica) are released to water bodies and act as fertiliser causing excessive unwanted algal growth (eutrophication). Weassess how natural and human driven nutrient processes can cause major problems in rivers.

Weather Station | Department of Geography | University of LincolnA Weather Station for the University of Lincoln
The School of Geography and Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health have recently set up an automatic weather station (AWS) on the rooftop of the Isaac Newton Building. This is a Davis Vantage Pro 2 model, which is industry standard and widely used worldwide.
We are logging data every 5 minutes of the following parameters: air temperature (nearest 0.1 degrees Celsius), relative humidity (percent), barometric air pressure (millibars), wind speed (miles per hour) and direction (degrees), precipitation (rain-+snow-fall in millimetres), and solar radiation (Watts per square metre).
The air temperature and humidity sensors are in a white louvered plastic radiation shield to protect them from the Sun and rain, and have a solar-powered fan to improve measurement accuracy. There is also an ultraviolet light intensity meter, and we plan to add a sky-view camera to provide a record of changes in sky conditions and cloud cover.
Meteorological data, which we began logging on 21 December 2018, are archived in perpetuity and are freely available to anyone in the University for teaching or research purposes. Please contact Professor Edward Hannaor Dr Joe Harwoodif you would like access to the archived data, clearly stating what time period and parameters you are interested in receiving and a brief purpose of your project.
Within the School of Geography we plan to use the data in a variety of student projects and for micrometeorology and climate change research. Example studies might include of the urban heat island effect in and around Lincoln, and short-term meteorological variations linked to extreme weather events. It is also planned to submit monthly summaries of our weather data to the Climatological Observers Link national network.



Field Trips | Department of Geography | University of LincolnField Trips
Fieldwork and PracticalLearning
s core skills in gathering, collating, and analysing data. Fieldwork destinations have previously included the Lincolnshire coast and Crete, Greece.", 'Lincolnshire
During the first year of our undergraduate programmes students undertake a field week focused on the theme of A Sustainable Lincolnshire. Three environments from the local area are studied including the urban environments of Lincoln and Skegness, the rural environments at Horncastle and the Fens, and the coastal environment at Gibraltar point.
Crowle Moor
In the Climatology and Quaternary Science module, BSc Geography students learn how to interpret past environmental change. In previous years, a field trip to Crowle Moor, Lincolnshire has taught students how to sample natural archives using this peatland as an example. Students can participate in sample and data collection.
Crete
During the Hazards and Society module, second year undergraduate students undertake a field excursion to learn skills and data collection techniques across the spectrum of geography. In previous years, students visited Crete for a week to explore the diverse geographies and histories of environmental hazards in the north and south of the island.
Chile
Third year undergraduates have previously visited central and southern Chile as part of the optional Overseas Fieldwork module. In keeping with the integrated themes of our programmes, students have explored human and physical geographies relating to urban inequalities and gentrification, glacial environments, mining, extractivism, and geoheritage.


Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | Research | University of LincolnThe Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health (LCWPH) focuses on solving the most pressing global environmental and societal challenges related to aquatic ecosystems and water resources. These include hydrological and sea-level impacts of climate change, flood-related contamination from metal mining and processing, and water-borne and vector-borne diseases affecting humans and animals, as well as behavioural, political, and economic adaptation mechanisms to mitigate environmental and human health impacts.
Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health (LCWPH) is the first interdisciplinary research centre of its kind in the UK to focus on solving the most pressing environmental and societal issues emerging from water-related risks on human and ecosystem health in aquatic environments.
To understand these complex socio-environmental interactions and develop effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, the interdisciplinary research within the LCWPH links environmental sciences with humanities and human health.
The LCWPH uses the emerging idea of Planetary Health (the health of human civilisation and the state of the natural systems on which it depends) and integrating it with river, catchment, and coastal science in order to make this important concept operational for delivering evidence-based water and health interventions providing the underpinning science to tackle a series of UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Learn more about the focus of theLCWPH and its dedication topromoting research into the most serious global environmental and social problems related to Earths great rivers under the foundational directorship of Professor Mark Macklin andProfessor Chris Thomas in an article with Research Outreach,Water and planetary health: Protecting the lifeblood of human civilisation.
Our Research
Waterborne and Vector-borne Disease
Coasts and Catchments
Coastal erosion and coastal flooding range among the most severe concerns of coastal communities. We integrate riverine and coastal research to unravel the interactions and feedback mechanisms between coasts and catchments to better understand the resilience of natural and social coastal systems.
River Science
Rivers satisfy multiple social needs in terms of resources and services but are affected by a wide range of human activity, which reduce the environmental and societal services they provide. We tackle these issues in the interdisciplinary framework of River Science, which stands at the interface of geomorphology, ecology, engineering, and social sciences.
Ecosystem Dynamics
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health aims to understand ecosystem dynamics using a variety of techniques for spatial and temporal scale reconstructions to determine global patterns, ecological response, long-term change, and ecosystem function.
Environmental Contamination
We research contamination at basin, catchment to global scale, arising from past and present mining, agriculture, urban developments, and industry. The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health aims to develop new approaches to risk management and sustainable development.
Key Projects
Disentangling Southern Hemisphere climate and environmental interactions of the late Pleistocen
This project explores drivers of terrestrial ecosystem responses to glacial/interglacial transitions through the Late Pleistocene, in Tasmania, Australia. We will perform 18Odiatom to determine the number glacial/interglacial cycles preserved in the Darwin Crater record, the nature and timing of these transitions, and the complex terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem interactions of the past.
Northwest European Seasonal Weather Prediction from Complex Systems Modelling
The atmospheric circulation and jet stream over the North Atlantic strongly influence seasonal weather conditions over Northwest Europe. This project seeks to improve current seasonal forecasts, develop seasonal forecasts for Northwest Europe, and assess the benefits of skillful probabilistic seasonal forecasts to interested end users such as the agri-food industry.
FLOODMAL: The impacts of flooding and changed river flows on malaria hazard 
Malaria is a vector-borne disease which occurs where Anopheles mosquito vectors, Plasmodium parasites, and vulnerable human populations coincide. Whilst the effect of temperature on malaria vectors has been widely studied, this project studies the impacts of changed river flows on malaria hazard, and the intervention efforts required to address them.
Rivers of Gold: The Legacy of Historical Gold Mining for Victoria's Rivers
Rivers are cultural artefacts that have been transformed by significant human intervention. During the nineteenth century the gold-mining industry deposited large quantities of soil in rivers across South Eastern Australia. This project uses industrial archaeology, geomorphology and environmental chemistry to find out what happened to the rivers as a result.
The environmental fate of emerging contaminants and antibiotic-resistant genes in river sediment and floodplains of the Ganga basin
The Ganga basin has become increasingly polluted with a cocktail of persistent organic pollutants, plasticizers, and heavy metals. This project undertakes the first event-based and catchment-scale (mountain-to-ocean) investigations of emerging contaminants (ECs), and microbial population dynamics, in river channel sediments and floodplains of the Ganga basin including its major tributaries.
People and Publications
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health is led by Professor Mark Macklin and Professor Chris Thomas. The group includes members from across the Department of Geography.

Nestor Vercher: Rural Social Innovation; examples from Spain & Scotland"
This seminar provided Nestor the chance to introduce himself and his doctoral research which focuses on social innovation. In particular, his research examines social capital creation through community-based rural projects in Ibiza and Formentera, the rural regions around Seville and Aberdeenshire. Nestor a visitor of the School of Geography and Rural Visionsis keen to find out some more examples of rural social innovation here in the England.
Visit of Professor Dirk Strijker
Professor Strijker made a short visit to the School of Geography and continues as an active researcher in rural development, farming, and rural societies. Professor Sam Hillyard, Dr Gary Bosworth and Professor Strijker are working on a book proposal Research methods for rural studies.
Dr Gary Bosworth: Social and Spatial Rural Mobilities
In this seminar, Gary presented a conference paper that he is taking to the Regional Studies Winter Conference which attempts to combine recent work on rural transport with his previous research into counterurbanisation. This will explore the hypothesis that personal mobility and population-level mobility into and out of rural regions are linked to recent evidence suggesting that social mobility remains weak in many rural parts of England.

The latest meeting of Rural Visions focused on rural socio-economic challenges and sought to identify the key research questions that could help to address these. A central theme to the conversation was rural isolation and loneliness  not unique to rural areas  but a growing concern with rising rates of rural homelessness and ageing rural populations.

How Does Our Rural Research Contribute to the Universitys "Civic Mission?
This will be a chance to discuss our research in terms of its wider societal importance. If anyone has a rural impact case study under development or is working with rural research users, this is a chance to present your work to the group and build your networks. This is intended as a precursor to a Rural stakeholder event later in the year.
Do We Adapt Our Research Methods for Rural Contexts?
With smaller and sparser populations, and with different interpretations of the meaning of rurality, does rural research need to be framed or conducted differently? Please offer any examples that you think demonstrate the need for (or not) any distinctive approaches. We are working on a book proposal and will be putting out a call for chapters connected to this session.

Development | DIRE | University of LincolnDevelopment
Our interdisciplinary team addresses the fundamental challenges associated with development, and the dynamics of those challenges in the Global South compared to the Global North. Key challenges in the Global South include lack of basic human rights and resource depletion. By comparison, the Global North is faced with overcoming the legacy of neoliberalism, including the social and environmental burden of western economies on less wealthy regions. While the barriers and opportunities related to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals vary geographically, there are also common deep causes, including the colonial roots of modern-day challenges. Unpacking these causes of causes is a central objective of our research group, and an essential step towards eradicating inequalities between developing and developed nations, as well as within regions.

Research | Department of Geography | University of LincolnWelcome
To establish the Universitys standing and increased reputation for quality research and strategic partnerships with funders, government, and business, we have chosen to actively place research centres and groups at the heart of our strategic plans.
Catchments and Coasts Research Group
Catchment and coastal processes affect billions of people across the globe in the most diverse ways, e.g. by providing water resources and natural habitat, by providing suitable grounds for extensive agricultural activity, human settlements and recreational environments, as a host of abundant biodiversity, and as a source of threats from natural disasters such as flooding or erosion.
Development, Inequality, Resilience, and Environments (DIRE)
Development, Inequality, Resilience and Environments addresses the most urgent and immediate threats to the resilience of human-environment systems and seeks to understand the complex interactions between societies and the landscapes they inhabit that precipitate vulnerability, including rural and urban dynamics.
Tackling climate change and reversing environmental degradation are among the most important tasks facing the world in the 21st century. University of Lincoln climate researchers are developing innovative solutions to the challenge of sustainability through inter-disciplinary research in key areas, including climate science, impacts, adaptation, policy, and governance.

DIRE | Research | University of LincolnOur Research
Many of the greatest challenges facing societies today occur at the nexus of environmental degradation and social marginalisation; deprived communities in both the Global South and the Global North often live in poor environmental conditions and deprivation is associated with vulnerability, including an increased likelihood of being severely impacted by the current Covid-19 pandemic. The University of Lincoln was one of the first signatories to the Civic University Agreement, demonstrating our commitment to reducing inequalities, removing barriers to access for underrepresented groups, and promoting resilience in our communities. Our research group addresses the key theme of Communities,advocated by the University throughdiverse inter-and-transdisciplinary research into the upstream causes of causes that produce inequalities in built and natural environments, and innovative methods of promoting development and resilience in vulnerable spaces.
Our research group addresses the most urgent and immediate threats to the resilience of human-environment systems and seeks to understand the complex interactions between societies and the landscapes they inhabit that precipitate vulnerability, including rural and urban dynamics. Thus, our scope also contributes to the growing body of research undertaken by University of Lincoln academics around Sustainability, in particular environmental justice, and the role of governance, both within the UK and abroad.

Climate Change and Extreme Weather Events | Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health | University of LincolnOur Research
The Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health is involved in research on climate change and seasonal forecasting, investigating extreme weather events, their predictability, and whether they are becoming more frequent in a changing climate. Further work explores the effects of global warming on the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets.
Seasonal Forecasting
Recent winters have been mild and wet but also had some extreme cold events. If seasonal weather is predictable in advance, there would be great benefits to society. To date there is little predictability for summer in weather forecasting models and we are working towards solving this problem.
Arctic Mid-latitude Linkages
The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on earth, a phenomenon known as Arctic Amplification. This is thought to have an impact on mid-latitude weather via changes in the jet stream.Lincoln Centre for Water and Planetary Health is actively engaged with international researchers, in order to establish the nature of these links and any impact on extreme weather events and to understand their societal implications.
Ice Sheets and Global Warming
We are investigating the effects of limiting global warming to 1.5C by 2100 on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Results from computer simulations are used to establish the sensitivity of ice sheets to climate change. This work will help to inform estimates of future sea-level rise.

Environments | DIRE | University of LincolnEnvironments
In 2020 Dr Moore published a study following her Doctoral research in Australia about the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), examining the political and economic challenges associated with achieving sustainable water management in the context of climate change and increasing financial constraint. The study considered the institutional arrangements that dictate how water is recovered for environmental purposes at the basin scale. The paper suggested that efforts to secure water for environmental purposes like the artificial watering of flood-plains would fall short of the minimum amounts required to ensure the survival of ecosystems in the MDB. In 2023, Professor Jamie Pittock at ANU suggests that as Dr Moore and colleagues expected, these efforts have failed to achieve the goals of the MDB Plan, including securing water for the environment. The analysis presented by Moore and colleagues (below) could help predict policy failures before they happen in regions with similar water entitlement arrangements (e.g., Chile).

Dr Moores research in the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia examines the political and economic challenges associated with achieving sustainable water management in the context of climate change and increasing financial constraint. Her studies consider the socio-psychological factors that facilitate or impede local-scale environmental behaviour, as well as the institutional arrangements that dictate how water is recovered for environmental purposes at the basin scale.

Seminars | DIRE | University of LincolnWelcome toDIRE Research GroupSeminars
Within the DIRE Research Group we deliver an annual seminar series that aims to promote knowledge sharing between academics across disciplines with shared interests in some of the biggest challenges facing societies and the environments they inhabit. The seminars include presentations from DIRE members as well as guest speakers from the UK and abroad. Find out aboutour speakers and seminars below, or get in touch with">Dr Harriet Moorefor more information.
s Hospital, Melbourne. The seminar is a big picture view of how children are faring in a changing world and is structured around a series of key questions: What just happened (to our physical and social worlds)? What impact have these changes had? What do we know about what children and families need? What have we tried? How effective have these efforts been? What do we need to do now? ", 'The second seminar is delivered by Dr Andrew Kythreotis, a Senior Lecturer in Political and Social Geography at the School of Geography, University of Lincoln. This seminar uses interview data with experts working on climate emergency declarations research across the UK, and will critically discuss four key themes that have underpinned and catalysed the changing geographies and the civil-state relationship within the climate emergency and what this may mean for future global climate governance under the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP). Three key points related to the geographies of climate will be highlighted policymaking: National Climate Policy Scalar Dissonance, Global Collective Policy Dissonance, The Covid Catalyst.
The third seminar is delivered by Dr Jen Manne-Goehler, a physician-scientist and faculty member at the Brigham and Womens Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. This seminar takes a broad view of the evolving epidemic of metabolic disease, including both obesity and diabetes. It explores the social, commercial, and health systems challenges for patients with or at high risk of metabolic disease and the transitions that have led this to become a truly global epidemic. A second area explored is how the global health community has not only come to recognise the metabolic disease as a top health priority but also explore the ways in which this community is attempting to address this essential health challenge.
The fourth seminar is delivered by Dr Julian Clifton. There are approximately 12 million people worldwide who are not recognised as nationals by any state. Statelessness affects peoples human rights, with stateless people unable to access education, health and work opportunities. Many stateless people are particularly vulnerable to persecution, trafficking and imprisonment. There are a number of economic and social drivers of statelessness which are often reinforced, whether by accident or design, by government policies in other areas. This presentation will explore the context and outcomes of statelessness in maritime Southeast Asia, where state policies relating to tourism and conservation undermine attempts to reduce statelessness.

Ecosystems | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnEcosystem-Based Coastal Adaptation to Climate Change
Coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services both to mitigate climate change and adapt to climate change. Using field data and numerical modelling, the restoration of previously lost coastal wetlands is studied as an integral part of developing sustainable coastal management plans to effectively harvest the ecosystem services provided by coastal wetlands. This research helps to inform local and national decision makers to implement ecosystem-based approaches to coastal adaptation with co-benefits to local communities and the wider society.
We work with local, regional and national stakeholders, such as the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds to quantify the coastal protection function of restored saltmarshes. Near Boston, Lincolnshire, for example, we use pressure sensors to measure wave heights and water levels within the Managed Realignment (a technique to restore saltmarshes by re-introducing the tidal regime into previously reclaimed land) Freiston Shore. This provides novel insights into the reduction of wave heights and water levels during storm surges.
This research will provide decision-makers with the necessary scientific evidence to develop long-term strategies for coastal adaption, and it will further our knowledge on how to build effective and sustainable coastal sea defences in the UK and elsewhere.

Civil Politics of Climate Change | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnThe New Civil Politics of Climate Change
DrAndrew Kythreotisis Principal Investigator on a British Academy and Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy grant (SRG19190291) (with Prof. Andrew Jonas (University of Hull) and Dr Candice Howarth (London School of Economics)) examining whether, and in what form, a new civil politics of climate change is emerging from recent populist climate events in the UK and around the world. These events include school climate strikes and declarations of a climate emergency, which in the context of uncertainty surrounding Brexit have generated new social, political and economic pressures within the UK state, yet have arguably created the societal conditions needed to catalyse increased citizen action on climate change. The aim of the research is to identify, and account for, some key elements of a new civil politics of climate change emerging at local and national scales across the UK.

Climate Change Education | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnClimateChangeEducation
Dr MercerandDr Kythreotis are currently working on a project that assesses the potential for higher education (HE) students to engender greater public participation and climate action amongst school pupils through the creation of educational games. The study develops a new approach to climate change education (CCE) and education for sustainable development (ESD) whereby HE geography students become co-producers of climate knowledge and action through creating, playing and delivering games in a life-cycle approach. The research will culminate in a university outreach programme led by university students that will see an interdisciplinary team forging important links with school teachers and school students. It is expected that the results will enhance the CCE and ESD capacities in schools, colleges and universities, adding new insights into climate education and pedagogy into the 21st century.

Lincoln Climate Research Group | Research | University of LincolnLincoln Climate Research Group (LCRG)
Through our wide-ranging and transdisciplinary research into climate science, impacts and policy, the Lincoln Climate Research Group directly address the following key themes:
Sustainability: Tackling climate change and reversing environmental degradation are among the most important tasks facing the world in the 21st century. University of Lincoln researchers are developing innovative solutions to the challenge of sustainability through inter-disciplinary research in key areas, including climate science, impacts, adaptation, policy and governance.
The University has declared a climate emergency and is working with partners locally and globally on a range of short- and longer-term interventions to safeguard the future of our planet.
LCRG addresses the physical, social, environmental and political causes and drivers of climate variations over a range of temporal and spatial scales in the Global North and Global South. The interdisciplinary nature of this research group also feeds into other key themes within the University, such as Rurality (e.g. through climate impacts on agricultural production) and Communities (e.g. through climate-change impacts of and adaptation to floods and droughts, migration and cities).
Members of the Schools Climate research group have key roles in the newly formed Lincoln Climate Commission, whose mission is to harness the collective energy, vision and ambition of key stakeholders across Lincoln and Lincolnshire to deliver a step-change in its response to the climate emergency. For example, they have invited members of the Lincolnshire Flood Risk and Water Management Partnership steering committee, providing advice on flood resilience for Lincoln City Council and East Lindsey District and Boston Borough Councils.
The Lincoln Climate Research Group capitalises on our existing specialist research strengths in climate science, impacts, governance, and policy. It is a very timely initiative in view of our close involvement in and co-founding of the Lincoln Climate Commission.

Coastal Wetlands | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnClimate Change Impacts on Coastal Wetlands
Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on both the geomorphology and ecology of coastal wetlands, such as saltmarshes and mangroves. This may lead to substantial losses of valuable ecosystems in the decades to come. Field observations and modelling are used to estimate the impact of climate change, and more specifically global sea level rise and changes in global storm climates, on coastal wetlands.
We work in collaboration with local, regional and national stakeholders, such as Natural England and the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust to estimate how dune ecosystems and coastal wetlands in Lincolnshire and the UK respond to the climate change and sea level rise. In the National Nature reserves Gibraltar Point and Saltfleetby - Theddlethorpe Dunes, for example, we use remote sensing techniques, GIS modelling and field data collection to reconstruct the interactions between the geomorphological/ecological evolution and hydrological drivers to estimate their past and future development.
With the local-scale process knowledge gained from these studies we work to upscale the assessment of climate change impacts to continental and global scales. With our international collaborators, we develop modelling tools to help national and supra-national stakeholders to manage their coastlines more sustainably in the face of climate change.

Seasonal Weather Prediction | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnSeasonal Weather Prediction
More reliable predictions of seasonal weather would be hugely beneficial to society. Although there has been some skill for winter, so far there is little predictability for summer in weather forecasting models. Now a major new NERC-funded research project led byProf. Edward Hanna aims to transform the way forecasters model the effects of the jet stream and other atmospheric circulations on the weather of Britain and its near neighbours. Better seasonal weather forecasts are valuable not just for holidaymakers but also public policy, like authorities responsible for flood prevention, and particularly the food and farming industry - where a poor harvest caused by extreme weather can wreck livelihoods and push prices up for consumers.
The North Atlantic Jet Stream is a giant current of air which strongly influences seasonal weather conditions in Northwest Europe. Its strength and location can drive extreme weather events in the UK and nearby countries, like flash floods, freezing winters or scorching summer days. Until recently it was thought the jet stream was too unpredictable to effectively model in seasonal weather forecasts. Its behaviour is believed to be driven by a variety of factors, ranging from sea ice changes to fluctuations in solar radiation. Other atmospheric phenomena - like the infamous El Nio effect and even volcanic eruptions - are thought to shape its characteristics from one year to the next. Modern physics-based dynamical seasonal forecasting systems run on giant supercomputers have enhanced forecasting accuracy for winter months but seasonal forecasts of the summer climate in the UK and Northwest Europe have remained defiantly difficult to model consistently.
A team of climate scientists led byProf. Hanna has been awarded UK Government research funding to develop innovative probabilistic statistical forecasts of the state of the North Atlantic jet stream. The researchers plan to combine a complex statistical method known as NARMAX and machine learning technologies to provide the UK and Northwest Europe with improved seasonal regional forecasts - including more accurate summer climate predictions. Pilot studies using the technique, published in a paper in the Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society in 2019, have already shown promising results.
The three-year research project Northwest European Seasonal Weather Prediction from Complex Systems Modelling has been allocated 650,000 UK Government grant funding from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). It is a collaboration between the Universities of Lincoln, Oxford, Reading, and Sheffield, and involves the Met Office, the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts and various organisations from the agri-food sector.

The Greenland Ice Sheet and Global Warming | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnThe Greenland Ice Sheet and Global Warming
The Greenland Ice Sheet is a giant reservoir of ice that contains enough water to ultimately raise global sea-level by seven meters.Prof. Edward Hanna recently led an international team involving Belgian, Danish, Swiss and American glaciologists and climatologists that published work (International Journal of Climatology, 2020) which quantifies the response of the Greenland Ice Sheet to climate change, based on weather station data and computer modelling. He is also involved in further work that is currently extending Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance (monthly snow accumulation minus surface meltwater runoff) records back to 1806. This body of work helps inform estimates of climate-cryosphere sensitivity and global sea-level rise, and our previous results have been used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
Our recent published results provide an updated analysis of Greenland surface air temperature data for the last three decades through to 2019, focusing mainly on coastal weather stations but also analysing records from relatively long-running sites on the interior plateau of the ice sheet. We found that Greenland coastal regions warmed significantly by about 4.4 degrees Celsius in winter and 1.7degC in summer from 1991 to 2019. Our work, combining Greenland temperature data with computer model output of ice-sheetmassbalance for 1972 to 2018, shows that each 1degC of summer warming corresponds to some 91 billion tons per year of surface mass loss and 116 billion tons per year of total mass loss from the ice sheet. Prof. Hannasresearch team used some of the latest available global and regional climate modelling tools to estimate that, under sustained strong global warming, Greenland is likely to warm 4.0 to 6.6 degC by the year 2100. These recent and projected future Greenland warmings are considerably greater than global temperature changes for equivalent time periods, reflecting a high sensitivity of the polar regions to climate change. We then used the relation we derived between recent changes in Greenland summer temperature and surfacemass balanceto calculate a 10 to 12.5 centimetres increase in global sea levelby 2100 arising from increased Greenland ice melt and surface mass loss.

Arctic Mid-latitude Climate | Lincoln Climate Research Group | University of LincolnArctic Mid-latitude Climate and Weather Linkages
The Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on earth, a phenomenon known as Arctic Amplification. This is thought to have an impact on mid-latitude weather via changes in the jet stream and polar vortex.Supported by World Climate Research Programme Climate and Cryosphere project and International Arctic Science Committee funding,Prof. Edward Hannais actively engaged with international researchers, in order to establish the nature of these links and any impact on extreme weather events and to understand their societal implications. From 2015 to 2021 our Arctic-midlatitude linkages group has published a series of high-profile review papers on this topic. Further work conducted byProf. Hanna has shown that the North Atlantic jet stream has become significantly more variable from year to year in winter (graph below) and this is linked to more severe weather experienced in the UK in the last 10-15 years. AlsoProf. Hanna carries out fundamental research into blocking high air pressure changes over Greenland and their links with global and Arctic warming, the North Atlantic jet stream and Northwest European extreme weather. He has developed Greenland Blocking Index datasets that are archived by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (the US weather and climate service) and widely used internationally.Prof. Hanna is also a regular co-author of NOAAs annual Arctic Report Card, which reviews the latest climate changes and impacts in the Arctic.

A wide variety of approaches have been applied to quantify NBS impact, including field measurements, UAV surveys, and numerical modelling addressing the following NBS themes:
Natural flood management
Restoration of coastal ecosystems
Managing sediment dynamics
Working with communities to implement nature-based solutions


Coastal Geomorphology  | Catchments and Coasts Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
CCRG works across a wide range of topics related to coastal geomorphological processes, particularly those related to the response of the fine-sediment coastal ecosystems, such as tidal mudflat, saltmarsh, mangroves and seagrass meadows, to natural, climatic and human pressures arising from Global Change
Global coastal wetlands and sea level rise
Coastal wetlands such as saltmarsh and mangroves are considered as vulnerable ecosystems with regards to climate change and global sea level rise. Estimates of future losses of coastal wetlands due to sea-level rise reach up to 80% until 2100.
CCRG members are working on the European Union funded REST-COAST project with 37 other partners. The overarching project aim is to investigate to what extent can upscaled coastal restoration provide low carbon adaption to rising sea levels and can it reduce risks and produce biodiversity gains for vulnerable coastal ecosystems like wetlands and seagrass beds? The members of CCRG are helping answer these questions focusing on modelling current global intertidal wetland extent and projections for the extent in the future under growing social and climatic pressures.
Impact of storms and sea level rise on local coastal wetlands
CCRG member are working with local partner to monitor the long-term development of saltmarshes in the Lincolnshire coasts. Surface-Elevation Table, a measurement technique that allow for the long-term monitoring of surface elevation changes are maintained and monitored in the marshes of the Gibraltar Point and the Saltfleetby-Theddlethorphe National Nature Reserves. The data collected as part of this effort will help CCRG to understand the impact of long-term sea level rise and extreme storm events on the morphological development of these valuable saltmarshes.
Reconstruction of past coastal environments
Members of the CCRG are working on coastal ecosystems along the Lincolnshire coastal (e.g. Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve and Saltfleetby-Theddlethorpe National Nature Reserve) in the UK to study the past habitat developments and associated changes to habitat diversity and carbon sequestration over time. This research specifically aims to provide an evidence base for sustainably manage these valuable coastal ecosystems.
Coastal environments and anthropogenic pollutants
Members of the CCRG, including our PhD student Gertuda Zieniute, are working at the Freiston Shore managed realignment in the Wash, UK investigating geochemical changes and microplastics accumulation over the last twenty years.

Catchments and Coasts Research Group | Research | University of LincolnCatchment and Coastal Processes in the Light of Global Change
Catchment and coastal processes affect billions of people across the globe in the most diverse ways, e.g. by providing water resources and natural habitat, by providing suitable grounds for extensive agricultural activity, human settlements and recreational environments, as a host of abundant biodiversity, and as a source of threats from natural disasters such as flooding or erosion. With increasing impacts arising from human activities in river catchments, coastal systems and ongoing climate change, these threats to natural habitats, biodiversity and resident communities are increasingly exacerbated. To gain a more detailed understanding of these impacts, CCRG considers catchments and coasts as interconnected and integrated systems, which are critically important to understand the outcomes of climate change and human impacts (e.g. land-use change) for rivers, catchments and coastal zones.
Hard engineering (i.e. the construction of hard flood protection infrastructure) has traditionally been applied to address flooding and erosion related risks in river catchments and coastal systems. However, the scientific community as well as catchment and coastal managers are increasingly recognizing the urgent need for utilizing natural dynamics to reduce risks from flooding and erosion, thereby enhancing the sustainability of flood and erosion mitigation strategies, restoring natural habitats, increasing biodiversity, enhancing groundwater recharge, and creating additional sinks for atmospheric carbon to support national net-zero carbon target. However, to develop innovative and effective NBS, it is of critical importance to work with (rural) communities to adequately quantify economic impacts of NBS and develop strategies for communities to benefit from the implementation of NBS. In CCRG, we aim to bridge the gap between catchment and coastal managers wanting to implement NBS and resident communities for the successful implementation of these schemes.

s most pressing problems, now and into the future.", 'Our Research
Catchment Processes 
Catchment processes include the interconnection of the terrestrial and aquatic environment. Our catchments are sensitive to changes in climate, land-use, and natural processes. Changes in our catchments can implications for our fluvial systems and coastal landscapes. Our research focuses on the impacts of climate and human activity on terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems. 
Fluvial Geomorphology 
River systems drain water and carry sediments from the catchments to coastal areas, and concentrate a wide range of resources and ecosystem services. Our research focuses on understanding the fundamental processes that determine river forms and behaviours, changes due to direct human disturbances and climate change, and lies at the interface between geomorphology, ecology and hydrology.  
Coastal Geomorphology  
Coastal landscapes are formed by the power of waves and tides, and depend on sediments delivered by rivers. Global change, including sea-level rise and changing storm patterns, significantly modifies these drivers, and our research aims to estimate future coastal landscapes through modelling and the reconstruction of past coastal environments.  
Water Resources and Management 
Human impact and climate change exert increasing pressures on freshwater resources globally. These pressures include increased discharges on nutrients and pollutants, salinization of coastal ground water resources and deterioration of water quality as a consequence of increased intensity, and frequency of wild and bushfires. 
Nature-based Solutions 
Nature-based solutions utilise natural ecosystem services to address existing social and environmental issues. They are generally sustainable and low cost, and provide wide benefits; however, difficult to quantify the actual values. Our research aims to assess those social and environmental benefits through field surveys and numerical modelling works.

Catchment Processes  | Catchments and Coasts Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
The CCRG investigates global issues, such as climate change, human activity, land-use, and fire, and the implications to catchment processes including changes in vegetation, soil dynamics, water resources, and ecosystem health.
Fire impacts on the environment
Dr Beck and colleagues are interested in how fire is related to long-term climate change and how fire impacts our catchments, carbon stability, and aquatic ecosystems. Their work stretches from Australia to the UK.Dr Beck is investigating how terrestrial-aquatic ecosystems are impacted by climate in Tasmania, Australia.
Terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem interactions
The interaction between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are key to catchment processes. Therefore, it is important to understand how terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem interactions are altered over time and by external forces such as climate and people.
Changing land use and catchment management
Land use and land use change in river catchments are important drivers for change both catchment and coastal processes. Deforestation or reforestation of the river catchments, for example, have implications for the geomorphological development of rivers and coastal landforms such as estuaries and deltas. Increasingly, catchment management strategies are designed to enhance riverine habitat quality and reduce fluvial flood risk.
As part of her PhD research, Miyo Yoshiaki models how land use changes and common catchment management strategies impact on the delivery of fluvial sediment into estuaries and how they impact on long-term estuarine flood risks.
Agriculture and catchment processes
Managing river catchments to either reduce fluvial flood risks, enhance the value of natural habitats or improve water quality frequently involves modifying the function and use of agricultural soils and understanding how agricultural soils interact with fluvial and coastal systems.
CCRG collaborates with the UoL Soils Research Group to develop and in-depth understanding these processes, interactions and management implications.
Sediment dynamics in river catchments
Catchments deliver water but also sediments to the river network, and this determines fluvial processes. The magnitude, timing and type of sediments delivered to rivers depend on the location, extent, type and degree of connectivity of sediment sources at the scale of catchment, and on their changes over time due to the occurrence of natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Dr. Luca Mao investigates these processes in Andean and Alpine high gradient streams using a range of methods ranging from remote sensing, the use of drones to survey sediment sources areas, and the monitoring of sediment transport in rivers.

Fluvial geomorphology  | Catchments and Coasts Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
River systems across the global have long been inherently related to human development. Although most civilizations formed and thrived along rivers, they can represent a source of risks during floods, and suffer from anthropogenic pressures and global change.
Sediment transport processes at the scale of grains
The role of vegetation and large wood in river processes
The group focuses on identifying and quantifying the role of vegetation and large wood in determining the shape and morphological changes or gravel-bed rivers. Past investigations used flume experiments to observe channel changes caused by vegetation encroaching on sand-bedded rivers, and also focused on quantifying the role of land use change in the delivery of large wood to Andean headwater streams. Current investigations focus on the role of vegetation management (clearcut vs. three hinging vs. no interventions) on roughness in low-gradient rivers.
Human impacts in river systems
The group focuses on assessing the short- and long-term effects of direct and indirect human disturbances on river systems. Dr. Luca Mao focuses especially on the role of dams and hydropower plants operations on sediment transport and channel changes, and on the long-term effects on gravel mining in large gravel-bed rivers in Chile.
Tufa growth and the geometry of tufa barrages in streams
Tufa is the solid precipitation of calcium carbonate in freshwater systems. Under certain physicochemical characteristics of water and local geomorphological setting, tufa can grow a few mm per year, and can create staircase-like sequences of barrages that determine the morphology and ecology of streams. MSc student Antonia Foley monitors the growth of tufa in a stream of Lincolnshire and investigates the geometry of tufa barrages. 


 Water Resources and Management  | Catchments and Coasts Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
CCRG is working with national and international research teams and stakeholders to assess the impact of human impacts, climate change and other environmental drivers on catchment coastal water resources and helps to develop strategies for the sustainable use of river, surface and groundwater resources. Research foci within the theme include:
Fire Impacts on Freshwater Habitat
Wildfires are the future threat to freshwater quality globally. Recent research from the CCRG suggests wildfires not only burn biomass and soils layers which erode into nearby waterbodies and alter freshwater characteristics such as pH, turbidity, organic and base cation content. These fires also alter vegetation composition and in turn the underlying soil organic composition which causes shifts in aquatic ecosystem species composition, change in nutrient availability, and can reduce resilience to disturbance in freshwater systems.
Catchment Water Quality
Water quality is central to both humanitys ability to utilise water as a resource and the ecosystem services it can support. In the CCRG we research the quality of both ground and surface water systems and how these will alter with human action. We have a range of projects focusing on the water quality of Fenland catchments including the risk of salinization of groundwater, the transportation of microplastics in Fenland Rivers and phosphorus driven eutrophication risks to Fenland rivers. Beyond this our team have worked internationally including collaborating with other universities on circum-Himalayan catchments (e.g., Ganga, Mekong etc.).
Soils and Water 
Soil is both a gateway for water to enter catchments and, in managed systems, a key utiliser of catchment water via irrigation. The CCRG conducts applied research in agriculture and land management, with projects on irrigation, drainage and agricultural water resources. Current work focusses on brackish water resources in coastal agriculture, and the impacts of saline irrigation on soil health.

Peatland Catchments
Peatlands are key carbon stores and unique habits and Lincolnshire is rich in these resources. The CCRG works with land managers and trusts to deliver impactful research to support the restoration of lowland peatlands as well as detailed chemical analysis to understand carbon storage processes in these systems.


Year 2 Geography Placement Module | Geography Placements | University of LincolnYear 2 Placement: Work Experience
In the second year, all undergraduate Geography students are able to choose an optional module to undertake a work placement for one day a week for ten weeks with a local organisation. The work placement module provides students with an opportunity to develop their professional skills by spending time with an employer.
Students spend a minimum of 70 hours working under the direct supervision of the employer giving them an insight into the professional working environment and learning how their studies transfer into the real world of work. The assessment takes the form of a reflective learning report and academic poster focused on a specific element of their placement.
Our placement partnerships include - Lincolnshire County Council, OpenPlan, Lincolnshire Community and Volunteer Service, Whisby Nature Reserve, East Midlands Ambulance Service, Knights Plc, East Mercia Rivers Trust, Delta Simons.
During my placement, I mainly worked within the Water Resource Planning and Water Quality Team which oversees the usage and contamination of water as well as the abstraction of water from the Lincolnshire area. My work involved the South Forty Foot Catchment, using GIS software called Easimap to map abstraction points along the foot. My second project was to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a constructed wetland in these locations. During my placement, I was able to give two major presentations which helped me to develop my personal speaking and time management skills. I also used a variety of software during the placement including Easimap, Excel and EDRMS, and developed a lot of problem-solving and critical skills.
My placement with the East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) was fantastic. I really enjoyed myself and found it interesting. It was quite eye opening to get an insight into EMAS and how this relates to Geography, as the research they are doing is extremely important. I am currently working with the Deputy Head of Clinical Audit and Research on an abstract and a poster that is being sent to Madrid for a conference. It is about Cardiac Arrest response times and how this can be improved. I also got the chance to sit in on 999 calls to help me get an insight as to where the data that I have been analysing comes from and to understand the severity of some of the calls.
Working with Lincolnshire Rivers Trust allowed for a real-time look into the different conservation projects that are taking place throughout Lincolnshire and how we as people have a direct impact on the natural environment.  I believe that in doing a placement it has allowed a broader knowledge on how geography links with the outside world. It is important to contextualise what you are learning about during the time of study to allow an in-depth understanding of topics and the importance of what we learn as geographers.
