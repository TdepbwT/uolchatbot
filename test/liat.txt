Safe drinking water is vital for human health and diffuse pollution of nitrogen and pesticides from agriculture is the main obstacle to meet drinking water quality targets. FAIRWAY is looking to review approaches for protection of drinking water resources against pollution by pesticides and nitrate, and to identify and further develop innovative measures and governance approaches for a more effective drinking water protection. Under these objectives, FAIRWAY is running a series of projects.
Issues with water quality in the Anglian region predominantly relate to high nitrate concentrations and pesticide contamination of surface waters. Anglian Water, the largest of 10 treatment and water supply companies in the UK, supplying drinking water to 4.2 million customers across England and Wales, are collaborating with the University of Lincoln and ADAS to improve drinking water quality by communicating with farmers and land managers in water catchment areas.
Anglian Water is working to improve drinking water quality using three approaches to encourage change in farmer practice, reducing on-farm pesticide usage, with an initial emphasis on metaldehyde.
LIAT are using surveys and interviews with farmers in the three study areas, to gather data around farmers current pesticide handling behaviour and practices, business characteristics, factors influencing practices and cost-effectiveness as well as wider effects.
The study will report on critical factors in developing an intervention programme for long-term change.

s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 727984", 'A project hoping to tackle the high cost of retail refrigeration has been led by a consortium comprising the University of Lincoln UK, Tesco Stores Ltd, the Grimsby Institute and Intelligent Management Systems Ltd. The full-scale project is calledtheDevelopment of Dynamic Energy Control Mechanisms for Food Retailing Refrigeration Systems.
The cost of retail refrigeration totals more than 14% of the UKs electricity usage and also represents roughly a third of a typical food and drink retailers energy cost. Supermarkets across the nation currently utilise thousands of refrigeration units, not only to keep our food and drink chilled but also to prolong the shelf life of produce and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria.
The researchdemonstrates the largest Demand Side Response (DSR) project to food retailing networks using the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. In the video below, Director of theLincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology(LIAT), Professor Simon Pearson, discusses how the Knowledge Transfer Network (KTN) helped identify funding through an Innovate UK competition.
Working collaboratively with partners, the University of Lincoln, UK, designed and built the Research Refrigeration Centre (RRC), which is the first facility of its kind in the UK and internationally. The centre precisely models the essential dynamics of a typical Tesco Express convenience store, providing space for researchers to explore the development of innovative refrigeration systems. This enables the team to discover new ways of thinking and create greater outcomes with a direct industry application, for example defining an optimum network infrastructure and control system to facilitate more efficient pack operation. In addition, the RRC is available as a demonstrator unit to other commercial organisations from the UK and internationally, making it a global centre for research into refrigeration technologies, which has helped the consortium to develop new relationships with world-leading organisations such as Walmart and Shell.
Throughout the project, the RRC has allowed the materials and systems developed by IMS and academics to be prototyped and tested in a simulated environment, making it a facility that can take blue skies thinking all the way through to mainstream industry in the shortest possible time. The University used the facility to establish a detailed understanding of engineering risks, by developing the first mathematical model (Matlab) to accurately mirror the essential dynamics of a Tesco Express convenience store, and using this to monitor response to DSR events. The team also developed a robust Simulink model of a 3-phase power system, which demonstrated the capacity of a massive refrigeration network to hold off a considerable load in response to a DSR event (circa 44MW across 112,000 assets). All of which developed industry confidence in the proposed candidacy solution.
The University of Lincoln has also created a new capability in the use of data and data analytics to build highly complex algorithms to balance the use of spare refrigeration capacity to generate revenue potential for demand response while, at the same time, ensuring food quality is not undermined.
Lincolns research has helped to raise the profile and reputation of the project within both the academic community and industry, achieving 4* publications and dissemination at international conferences and events. The project was also selected as a subject for a prestigious KTN case study. New opportunities to profit from the knowledge gained from this project include a successful EPSRC Internet of Food Things grant, plus a recent BBSRC Seeding Catalyst award, which will enable IMS, Tesco and Lincoln to continue working together to develop Refrigeration AI Control Technologies to resolve real-world issues such as optimising system performance in order to mitigate food wastage.

Agriculture in the coastal regions of Northern Europe is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Rising sea levels, saline intrusion of groundwater and greater pressures on our freshwater supplies have led to concerns about the impact of salt deposition on farmland soils.
SalFar (saline farming), is a project which aims to mitigate the potential threats of salinization through a collaboration of climate experts, researchers, educators, farmers, entrepreneurs and policy makers. In order to accomplish this, the project will conduct research on the salt tolerance of crops, demonstrating alternative methods of farming under saline conditions and creating new business opportunities for farmers, food producers and entrepreneurs.
The project is co-funded by the European Union Interreg programme for the North Sea Region and involves partners from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and the UK.
The University of Lincoln, SalFars UK partner, is taking a multidisciplinary approach to the project. The Lincoln Institute for Agri-Food Technology (LIAT) have joined forces with the School of Geography and Lincoln International Business School to model the current and future agricultural risks of salinisation, trial salt tolerant crops, and explore the business case for saline agriculture.

Greenhouse production of fresh fruit, vegetables and ornamentals is a successful, innovative component of the North Sea Region (NSR) economy with an output of 9 billion per year and directly employing more than 500,000 people. It embraces more than 10,000 SMEs with a high-value supply chain and it helps provide sustainable and healthy food to consumers. However, the producers in the NSR are facing challenges, such as high reliance on energy, water and low use of renewable energy. Eco-innovations in new or improved control methods and services is needed to reduce the use of resources (energy, water and chemicals) and to decrease the CO2 emission.
SMARTGREEN will use novel Big Data analysis of climate and production data to pinpoint unnecessary energy use and to improve the climate control. Combined with research and practical demonstrations in commercial greenhouses, this will secure a leap towards a greener and energy efficient production system. SMARTGREEN connects experienced research groups, leading SMEs and supporting companies to promote the greening of the NSR. By fostering innovative eco-enterprises, we can ensure greener growth, whilst reducing the environmental footprint significantly less pollution, lower emissions and longer-lasting use of resources. The transnational nature of SMARTGREEN will stimulate the development and adoption of eco-friendly and low-carbon products, green services and processes in NSR greenhouse industry.

Robotic Phenotyping | Research | University of LincolnOur Research
Robotic Phenotyping is the process of identifying crop growth (e.g. size and shape of the plant) and understanding the complex physiological and genetic traits of crops using robotic technologies. Using robotic sensing, measurement, and analysis techniques, we can identify how a plant is performing against its predicted growth plan. By using robots to consistently and repeatably observe and measure crop growth, we are able to help inform plant breeders and growers about the performance of a type of plant or group of plants.

Lincolnshire and north Cambridgeshire global innovation centre
Universities of Lincoln and Cambridge win 4.9m EPSRC award
Funding to boost drive to make region a global innovation centre for agri-tech

The Universities of Lincoln and Cambridge have been awarded a 4.9 million grant from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) to help fund their drive to make the Lincolnshire and north Cambridgeshire (LINCAM) region a global innovation centre for agricultural technology (agri-tech).
The LINCAM region is already a major UK production centre for crop-based agriculture and the associated supply chain. Its significance and sheer scale has led to the establishment of a nationally renowned agri-tech cluster  centred on the Universities of Lincoln and Cambridge, where interdisciplinary agri-food innovation is focused on digital technologies, including robotics and artificial intelligence, to boost productivity.
Now the hope is that the Place Based Impact Acceleration Account (PBIAA) award from the EPSRC  the main funding body for engineering and physical sciences research in the UK  will deliver a step change in activity. The aim is for the LINCAM region to become an agri-tech gateway for the world  enabling the development of technologies at industrial scale and providing export opportunities for agri-tech companies and inward investment opportunities within both the agri-tech and primary production sectors.
Simon Pearson, founding director of the Lincoln Institute of Agri-Food Technology at the University of Lincoln, said: "The LINCAM agricultural sector supports 88,000 jobs, generates gross value added (GVA) of 3.8 billion and farms more than 50% of the UK's grade 1 land. However, despite this scale, there are still significant challenges and opportunities.
"Food production accounts for 24% of all UK greenhouse gas emissions, leads to significant biodiversity losses and drives challenging social issues  not least from seasonal worker influxes to rural communities. In addition, farmers are under relentless cost pressures which are eroding supply chain equity and local economies.
"These challenges are acute across the LINCAM region but this funding award offers an opportunity to harness agri-tech to secure sustainable growth, bringing high-value and skilled jobs to the region, whilst mitigating the serious environmental impacts of the food production system."
The University of Lincoln has a long track record of agri-tech collaboration with the University of Cambridge and its commercialisation arm Cambridge Enterprise. Their work has included the setting up of Agriforwards CDT  the world's first EPSRC centre for doctoral training (CDT) in agri-food robotics. LINCAM will build on the success of their Ceres Agri-Tech partnership with three other leading UK universities and three renowned agricultural research institutes. Ceres, funded by Research England, provides translational funding and commercialisation expertise to drive agri-tech innovation by accelerating high-quality research to market. It has launched four agri-tech spin-out companies to date and created 13 licensing opportunities.
LINCAM will broaden participation in the cluster by offering access to the EPSRC funding to all UK higher education institutes involved in agri-tech research with the potential to drive economic and environmental or social sustainability in the region. Projects that are successful in securing a share of the funding will be actively mentored by the LINCAM team to accelerate the delivery of results.
Professor Miles Padgett, interim executive chair at EPSRC, said: "Im pleased to announce our first ten Place Based Impact Acceleration Accounts which will play a unique role in enhancing the capabilities of innovation clusters across the UK. A key priority for UKRI is to strengthen clusters and partnerships in collaboration with civic bodies and businesses, thereby driving regional economic growth."
The civic bodies involved in the LINCAM partnership include the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership, the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority and West Lindsey District Council.
