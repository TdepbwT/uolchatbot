Nominated Person Contact | Enrolment | University of LincolnThe University of Lincoln takes the welfare of all its students seriously and offers wellbeing support to students through a team of expert professional staff in our Student Wellbeing Centre. Under Data Protection law all students have the right to confidentiality to protect their interests and the Student Wellbeing Service is therefore committed to providing a confidential service to all students who engage with the service. The provision of this service also ensures a relationship of trust between student and staff which enables appropriate and timely support to be put in place for those students in need of it.
The Student Wellbeing Service requires a students consent to talk to anyone outside of the University about an individual, including parents and guardians. Whilst the service cannot confirm to a third party if a student is enrolled as a student, or their whereabouts they will follow up any concerns which are raised about students using the Universitys well established Concern for Welfare process which provides a rapid and co-ordinated response to any concerns which are raised by staff, students, parents or others about individual students.
Nominated Person Consent
When you enrol you will be given the opportunity to opt-in to a Nominated person consent. This will give the Student Wellbeing Service consent to contact your nominated person, this can be your parent, guardian, or a friend in situations which are not an emergencies, but where they have serious concerns about a students wellbeing. It is important to recognise that this opt-in does not allow parents, guardians, or a nominated person to seek information around your academic studies, or your day-to-day activities and will only be used in relation to concerns around your wellbeing.
If You Choose to Opt In
If you have chosen to opt in to the Nominated Person Consent and are the subject of a wellbeing concern, the Student Wellbeing Team will undertake an assessment of the situation and will then have the option to make contact with your Nominated Person to discuss any concerns and a plan of action to support you.


One Community Pledge | Enrolment | University of LincolnAt the University of Lincoln, we are One Community and strive to be kind, patient, and supportive of each other. Our One Community Values define our One Community ethos and are a framework to ensure that respectful and inclusive behaviours should be at the heart of all we do  for each other, our partners, and our customers (internally and externally) both in our thoughts and our actions.
With this in mind, we are asking all students to commit to the following pledge and to act responsibly within our community to ensure that we all thrive in a supportive and safe environment.
As a student at the University of Lincoln, I pledge to follow our One Community values which are outlined below:
Equality 
To respect and value all members of our community and actively reject discrimination, seeking to promote equality for all. To value diversity and believe that while we are all different, each of us deserves equality of opportunity and the right to transparency in how we are treated. 
Understanding
To recognise that we are all individuals, together as one community and, as part of this, recognise that we have different opinions, outlooks, and philosophies. To try to understand other points of view, even if we disagree with them.
Listening
 To give others our attention and respect and allow people the space to contribute to conversations. To listen to the quiet voices as well as the loud ones and speak up with them when we need to. 
Kindness 
To be kind to other people in the words we choose and the actions we take, especially when nobody else is looking or we will not benefit personally.
Acceptance 
To accept people for who they are, and respect each persons background, identity, beliefs, and differences. To appreciate the diverse range of experiences and perspectives in our community which strengthens it.
If you have a concern about the behaviour of others or need support, please contact the Universitys Student Support Centre atstudentsupport@lincoln.ac.ukor the Students Union Advice Centre atadvice@lincolnsu.comwho will provide you with support and take the necessary steps to positively resolve the concern.

Course Related Information | New Medicine | University of LincolnNew Medicine Students
Course Related Information
What is Expected of a Medical Student?
Medical students have different responsibilities to other students, and you are expected to uphold professionalism and behaviour to a different standard; being a member of the medical profession begins on day one of your course. Please ensure you read theMedical Student Contract for what is expected from you. Please also find a useful document on Professional Values, Behaviour, Health and Entry into Medicine.
Dress Code
You will be working in different environments, both academic (tutorials, library, lectures) and clinical (clinical skills, placements, wards). For an academic situation you may find that casual, comfortable clothing is appropriate but in a clinical environment you will be expected to adopt the bare below elbow approach.
You will undertake lectures and practical sessions in a laboratory environment and you will be required to wear appropriate protective equipment, including a laboratory coat. When on clinical visits and in clinical skills sessions, you will be required to wear surgical scrubs. Further information about dress codes and procedures in the various teaching environments will be provided to you as your course starts.
Working with Colleagues/Health Professionals
Throughout your time at Lincoln Medical School and beyond, you will work as part of multidisciplinary teams. Respecting the skills and contributions of other professionals is a must, along with following instructions given by health professionals in the workplace.
Although you will be learning and at times monitoring the health of others, remember to look after your own health. If you feel that your ill health will influence your standard of work or could affect patients and colleagues, speak to someone for advice and see a doctor.
Social Media
Social media has become part of everyday life but there are a few things to remember:
Further social media guidance can be found below:
General Medical Council Social Media Guidancehttps://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-hub/social-media
University of Nottingham Social Media Guidance for Medical Studentshttps://www.nottingham.ac.uk/medicine/documents/medicine-policies/social-media-guidance.pdf
General Medical Council Good Medical Practice Guidance for Medical Students https://www.gmc-uk.org/education/standards-guidance-and-curricula/guidance/student-professionalism-and-ftp/achieving-good-medical-practice
Mobile Phones
Mobile phones should be used appropriately and professionally. Using mobile phones can be distracting to teaching staff and it is advised that mobile phones are kept on silent or switched off during educational and clinical sessions.
Further information regarding professionalism and fitness to practise can be found here:
University of Nottingham Fitness to Practise Procedureshttps://www.nottingham.ac.uk/qualitymanual/2-documents/fitness-to-practise-procedure-mhs.pdf
Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)
The Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) is Moodle, and you will need your university username and password to log in. Moodle will support your course, and each of your modules has an area that will contain teaching resources. You will be given access to Moodle during induction. There will be guidance materials available on Moodle should you need help familiarising yourself with the platform.
Student Feedback
Medical students have numerous opportunities throughout the year to feedback their thoughts and comments. Some of the ways you can let us know how were doing are:
Professor Danny McLaughlin, Associate Dean for Medicine at Lincoln has an open-door policy and welcomes students to get in contact with him directly should they have any queries or concerns. More information about how to contact him will be available at the welcome talk during Welcome Week.
MyNottingham Portal and MyNottingham App
Once you have registered, you will be able to access the MyNottingham Portal. This is where you should update your personal details such as your address, telephone number, and bank details. On the Portal, you can manage your fees and finances, add your bank details, and enrol into the direct deposit. This will enable you to receive any payments from the University that you might be eligible for such as scholarships, bursaries, or travel reimbursements.
You can also access the MyNottingham App, which may be useful to you when you visit the University of Nottingham campus. You will find that items such your timetable cannot be accessed via this app. You will receive further information on how to access Lincoln-specific information at the beginning of the term. The MyNottingham App is also where you will need to self-enrol on optional modules (if applicable) during your course which you will receive further communication throughout the year to let you know what you need to do.
Later in the course you may be required to use the MyNottingham app to look at your exam information and timetable. This will be confirmed to you during the academic year but would normally be updated around April. This platform is where you will also view your assessment results. Communications around this will be from University of Nottingham.
