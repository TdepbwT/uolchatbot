After teaching EFL, ESOL, and EAP in three countries, I went back to university in 2012. I studied for an MA in Translation Studies then a PhD at the University of Leicester. I have always been interested in languages and translation. I am particularly interested in style and how, through translation, one could either preserve the style of the source text or manipulate it to make the target text more accessible to a wider readership. I coined the term exotericising to describe this process.

In my free time, I enjoy running and going on long hikes, hoping to discover what is around the next corner and the finding the way home.

Workshops | In-sessional support | University of LincolnAcademic English and Study Skills Workshops
English Language and Study Skills Workshops
Workshops are single session events that usually happen at the start and end of semesters. Each workshop focuses on a different topic; some focus on writing structure and some focus on communication.
Academic Vocabulary: Word Forms
Academic vocabulary is absolutely central to your learning: without it, you cannot understand or communicate your knowledge of a subject. In this workshop, we will explore how the component parts of academic words - word forms, prefixes, suffixes, and roots can help unlock their meaning, helping you to understand complex subject-specific texts. Using this knowledge, we use your new vocabulary knowledge to help you develop your paraphrasing skills.

This workshop will be run both on campus and online.
