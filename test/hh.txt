Members of the Medieval Studies Research Group work on a wide range of topics relating to the medieval city and diocese of Lincoln, medieval England, and the wider North Atlantic, including: the archaeology and history of medieval Lincolnshire; the church in the medieval diocese of Lincoln; English royal government in the thirteenth century; landscape and built environment in Britain; and trade and exchange in the medieval North Atlantic.
The Archaeology and History of Medieval Lincolnshire
Our research focuses on the archaeology and history of the medieval city of Lincoln and county of Lincolnshire in the centuries before the Black Death. We are interested in the physical remains and documentary evidence for rural communities in the county, and their manorial histories. We also work on the estates and settlements within the duchy of Lancaster, and on what its records reveal about the people of medieval Lincolnshire, and the evolution of regional identities and structures of lordship within the baronies of Bolingbroke and Brattleby between the late twelfth and the fourteenth centuries.
The Church in the Medieval Diocese of Lincoln
The medieval diocese of Lincoln was the largest episcopal see in England. Our research focuses on the records and careers of the medieval bishops of Lincoln, including Bishop Henry Burghersh (c. 1290-1340). We also study the history of Lincoln cathedral, its manuscript collections, and the early histories and records of local religious houses. Members of our research group serve as councillors, and include the general editor, of the Lincoln Record Society.
English Royal Government in the Thirteenth Century
The thirteenth century was a pivotal period in English political life. It witnessed the birth of Magna Carta and the emergence of the parliamentary state in the reigns of Henry III (1216-72) and Edward I (1272-1307). It also saw a growing level of sophistication and bureaucracy in the machinery of royal government, which was reflected in its record keeping. Our research focuses on the study of medieval government records, on the politics of the First Barons War of 1215-17, and on the later period of baronial reform and rebellion in England (1258-67). Our group includes the joint general editor of the Pipe Roll Society.
Landscape and the Built Environment in Britain
Our research examines medieval settlements through the study of both the landscape and the built environment in Britain. We are interested in the late medieval landscapes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and particularly in the field systems of those areas; our current fieldwork examines the character of Norse farming in Shetland. We are similarly interested in the archaeology of high medieval buildings in Britain, particularly those pre-dating 1200; long-term projects include the study of excavated timber buildings between 900 and 1200, and standing masonry buildings of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.
Trade and Exchange in the North Atlantic
Our research focuses on trading systems and the operation of commerce in the North Atlantic. Currently, our members are collaborators in an AHRC project examining the impact of commerce on the Northern Isles of Scotland in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, something which marked the end of the medieval period there.

Lynsey Coombs
Thesis Topic: The impact of medievalism on the curation of castles in the 21st century
Lynsey Coombs is a part-time PhD student in the School of History and Heritage. She obtained her BA in History at Newcastle University in 2008 and her MA is Museum Studies at the University of Leicester in 2016. Lynsey has over 12 years experience as a heritage professional and has worked for a number of organisations including Chatsworth House, English Heritage and University of Cambridge Museums. She is currently a Collections and House Manager at the National Trust based in Norfolk.
Lynseys PhD thesis explores the impacts of medievalism on the presentation and reception of castles as heritage sites in England. Her research examines whether castles tell the stories of the Middle Ages through the lens of medievalism, and if they do, what impact this has on visitors understanding about the buildings history.

Sarah Coyne
Thesis Topic: A song of love and hope: Gregory the Greats complete exegesis on the Song of Songs and its political, moral and social influence throughout his life
Sarah studied for her undergraduate degree in Religious Studies at Bishop Otter College, Chichester and studied for her masters in Medieval Studies at the University of Lincoln. Her interests during this time focused on Christianity and its changes throughout the epochs culminating in different rules and laws within each age. Sarah is currently studying full time for her MPhil/PhD and is supervised by Professor Jamie Wood and Dr Graham Barrett.
Her thesis considers how the Song of Songs was used by Gregory the Great and how it featured consistently throughout his written works including letters. Gregory the Greats Exposition on the Song originated from the conferences he gave to a small group of monks and clerics during his papacy in the mid 590s. Although it was intended to provide Gregorys audience with resources to address the temptation of the flesh and the battle between body and spirit, it also was used to instruct elite members of the Church on how to conduct their business within monasteries, and dioceses across Italy and Europe.

Bethany Elliott
s historical manors (PhD by Practice)", 'Bethany is a PhD student and an Associate Lecturer in the School of History and Heritage. She joined the University of Lincoln in 2019 to conduct research into Lincolnshires historical manors, as part of a PhD by Practice. In 2012, she completed a BA (Hons) in Archaeology and Ancient History at the University of Leicester, before completing an MSc in Forensic Investigation at Cranfield University in 2014. The use of archives for research during these studies led to her interest in the practice and she has since undertaken archival training at The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, specialising in Medieval Latin and palaeography, before completing an MA in Archive Administration at Aberystwyth University, to become a qualified archivist in 2017.
She began working on the Manorial Documents Register Project (MDR) with the National Archives in 2018. The project aims to locate, revise and digitise a list of all the manorial documents for England and Wales. Having completed the project for Cheshire, she is now completing the same, for Lincolnshire as part of a PhD by Practice. Her research involves not only completing the project, but also reflecting on archival practice within a project of this scale; including the challenges of locating the records, using multiple archive catalogues and making the MDR user-friendly. In addition to this, as the MDR project is now nearing its thirtieth year and has been completed in all but three English counties, Bethanys research analyses how the project could have been affected by advances in technology and user search methods during this timescale, as well as how the register will improve the understanding of manorial records in Lincolnshire.
Update: Bethany completed her PhD in 2022. Many congratulations!

Tina Lesley Jessica Holt 
Thesis Topic: Thomas Bek: Familial networks, ecclesiastical responsibility and politics
Jessica studied her MA in Medieval Studies at the University of Lincoln and is now a full-time MPhil/PhD student in History with Prof. Louise Wilkinson and Dr Michele Vescovi.
Her thesis examines how different ecclesiastical networks impacted upon the administration of the diocese of Lincoln during the tenure of Bishop Thomas Bek (who served as the Bishop of Lincoln between 1342 and 1347). Thomas Beks registers have largely been unexplored, and this project aims to provide new insights into this neglected figures time in episcopal office. It considers how familial connections within the Church; internal pressures within the Church; and the changing needs of the diocese influenced and affected the contents of his registers during his tenure.

Travis Linehan
Thesis Topic: The institution of Merovingian queenship
Travis Linehan is a part-time MPhil/PhD student in Medieval Studies. He achieved a BA Historical Archaeology at the University of York and obtained an MA in Medieval Studies at the University of Lincoln.
s interests are in both Frankish history and the study of historical queenship and his thesis, supervised by Drs Graham Barrett and Robert Portass, is focused on defining queenship as an institution within the Merovingian kingdoms, using a mixture of personal letters, record evidence, archaeological evidence, and contemporary histories written by figures such as Gregory of Tours.", '
Val Marden
Thesis Topic: Lions, dragons and other fabulous creatures: understanding animal representations at Lincoln Cathedral, 1250-1350
Val Marden is a part-time MPhil/PhD student in the School of History and Heritage. She obtained her BA in Archaeological Studies at the University of Leicester before working within various government departments and the RAF, and before taking early retirement from full time employment in 2016. She gained her MA (with Distinction) in the study of the Country House at the University of Leicester in 2018. Her dissertation examined the decoration of eighteenth-century English country house furniture with animal forms and motifs.
Vals thesis continues the theme of animal representations, as she explores the potential meanings behind some of the creatures sculpted in stone at Lincoln Cathedral during the years 1250-1350, an important timescale encompassing several significant building projects. Such images have often been dismissed as meaningless, merely decorative, grotesque or just amusing japes by masons, yet they are situated in important spaces where they were seen by both laity and the clergy. Vals research examines the likely significance of the animals and monsters in the spaces they inhabit, how the representations of creatures change over time and what effect they may have had on their different viewers.

Nicola C. Meyrick
Thesis Topic: Continuity, martyrdom and assimilation: remaining Christian in Al-Andalus
Nicola studied for a BA in American History and Politics at Manchester, and then worked for many years at the BBC as a current affairs producer and editor. She took early retirement in 2015 and then did an MA in Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies at Kings College, London.

Susan Phillips
Thesis Topic: Family Dynamics, Networks, and Intergenerational Influences: Women as Agents of Christianisation in Merovingian Gaul and Anglo-Saxon England
With a BA in French and History from the University of Leeds, and following a long career in education, teaching firstly modern foreign languages in secondary schools, then BA Education Studies at Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln, Sue completed her Masters degree in Medieval Studies at the University of Lincoln in 2019. Passionate about lifelong learning, Sue also completed a BSc in Geosciences with the Open University in 2014. She is now a part-time MPhil/PhD student, having begun her research in October 2020 under the supervision of Drs Graham Barrett, Robert Portass, and Jamie Wood.
Inspired by letters written by senior churchmen to Merovingian princesses in the late 6th and early 7th century urging them to secure the conversion of their pagan husbands by obeying the scriptures and by following the example of their common ancestor Queen Clothilde, wife of Clovis I, Sue is interested to know to what extent female intergenerational influences impacted on women as agents of Christianisation in the Merovingian and Anglo-Saxon periods. Her thesis poses two main questions. Firstly, with a specific focus on women, how do contemporary texts and letter collections of Merovingian Gaul portray the importance of, and attitudes towards, maintaining the elite family unit? And secondly, as a consequence, to what extent did family heritage and intergenerational influences impact on the religious beliefs and actions of younger generations of women?

Mark Presneill
Thesis Topic: Lincolnshire baronial family fortunes in the 12th Century: A comparative study of four lesser-known families between 1066 and 1216
Mark is a part-time PhD student in the School of Humanities and Heritage. He obtained his BA in History at Cardiff University in 1987 and his MA in Curriculum Studies at Christ Church Canterbury in 1994. Mark has over 30 years experience as a teacher of History and 15 years as a senior member of staff in a large Lincolnshire comprehensive school.
Marks PhD thesis examines the success and failure of a small number of lesser known Lincolnshire baronial families during the 12th century; Blankney, Freiston, Redbourne and Tattershall. The research investigates the impact of the changes to central government on local baronies and how powerful these families were in their areas of influence. There is consideration of the different strategies these families employed to survive, maintain and extend influence.

John Sandy-Hindmarch
Thesis Topic: The memory of the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings among reenactors and living historians
John Sandy-Hindmarch is a PhD student in the School of Film and Media. Having achieved a 1st in History at Nottingham Trent University in 2016, he then went on to obtain an MA in Viking and Anglo-Saxon Studies from the University of Nottingham. Since completing his MA in 2018, Johns research interests have shifted from analysing these early medieval peoples in their historical context towards how they have been perceived and remembered since their historical occurrence, particularly in the present.
In this context, Johns PhD project explores how the Anglo-Saxons and Vikings are understood, received, and connected with by Anglo-Saxon and Viking reenactors and living historians. Employing a qualitative method, John looks to uncover the nature of these individuals understanding of the Anglo-Saxon and Viking past, how this understanding is formed, and the extent to which their connections to the period are emotionally charged. Through this research John hopes to make a valuable contribution to the fields of both medievalism and memory studies, exploring how a period of the distant medieval past is brought into relation with the present.

Gary Stephen
Thesis Topic: The impact of Christian philosophies of animal rationality on ecclesiastical hunting practices in 13th Century England
Gary is a full-time MPhil/PhD student with the School of History and Heritage. He obtained his BA in English and History Studies from the University of Lincoln/UCNL in 2019. Following this, he came to Lincoln to complete an MA in Medieval Studies, which he achieved in 2020.
He is currently working on a doctoral thesis under the supervision of Professor Louise Wilkinson and Dr Jamie Wood. His work seeks to examine the ways in which 13th Century philosophers and theologians sought to make sense of an expanding understanding and experience of animal behaviour through the practice of Natural Philosophy. As animals came to be seen as more complex than previously assumed, it became important for scholars to establish a boundary between human and non-human animals. Further, the thesis seeks to examine the ways in which these arguments influenced and informed the hunting practices of English ecclesiastics and their subordinates.

Paula Del Val Vales
Thesis topic: Iberian and English queens households in the thirteenth century
Paula Del Val Vales is an MPhil/PhD student in the School of History and Heritage. She obtained her BA in History in the Universidad Complutense of Madrid with distinction in 2019. In 2020 she completed her MA in Medieval Studies at Kings College London. Her research interests include Iberian and English queenship, royal households, and womens history.
She is currently working on her thesis supervised by Professor Louise Wilkinson and Dr Antonella Liuzzo Scorpo. Her thesis is a comparative study ofqueens households and courts in the thirteenth century across three kingdoms: Castile, Aragon, and England. Through this thesis she aims to explore the queens establishments, their resources and personnel, and whether their households constituted their own power bases or not. This thesis will also have a particular focus on the unedited household and wardrobe accounts of Eleanor of Provence, queen of England.

We also work closely with research students in Classics, who share similar interests in Latin culture:

Joe Broderick
Thesis topic: The epigrammatist Martial as social commentator on Flavian Imperial Rome
Joe Broderick has recently started his PhD with the School of History and Heritage, following his graduation with a First-Class Honours Degree in History BA, and a Distinction Pass in his MA in Medieval Studies. He specialised in Roman and early to mid-medieval history, particularly the Roman army and their relationship with the emperors, and Anglo-Saxon England. His supervisors for his project are Dr Graham Barrett and Dr Jamie Wood, with Graham acting as lead supervisor.
His thesis concerns the first-century AD epigram writer Martial, and his potential role as social commentator. We can see through his work, in his presentation of the everyday life occurrences in the Rome of his day. Broadly speaking, this research project will aim to fill in some of the gaps in the social history of early imperial Rome through Martials Epigrams and analysis of the literary genre, giving us greater awareness of the picture of Rome and her people Martial sought to portray, within the framework of a social (and to an extent literary) history study.
Many historians have pointed out that, due to the nature of Martials writing and the contradictions present within the Epigrams, his presentations of everyday life cannot be taken at face value. Some have even gone so far as to dismiss Martial as a source of any serious historical study, a chief reason for this selection of Martial for my thesis. This does not negate the value of the source for research, it just needs a more gentle and nuanced examination. It is arguable that Martials Epigrams offer richer and more varied depictions of Romes places, objects, and structures than any previous work in the Roman poetic tradition, and it is through these examinations the aims can be achieved.



Archives Heritage and Medievalism | Medieval Studies Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
The Medieval Studies Research Group is interested not only in the medieval period itself but also in the later interpretation and representation of the medieval past. Our members work with, study, and publish widely on archives and medieval records, and also interpret the medieval past for the public.
Archives and Medieval Records
Our research focuses on the study, editing, and translating of different types of medieval records, as well as the contexts of their production and their preservation. This research includes: diplomatic material as sources for social and cultural history; the history of manuscript libraries and the study of paleography; the cataloguing, editing, and study of charters and archival documents from early medieval Spain and Portugal (eighth to eleventh century); published transcriptions and translations of medieval bishops registers and comital household accounts, with new editions of the household records of Henry IIIs queen, Eleanor of Provence, currently in preparation. We are also developing projects and initiatives with Lincoln Cathedral Library and The National Archives of the United Kingdom.
Interpreting the Medieval Past for the Public
The art forms present in our world - whether they be visual, architectural, literary, filmic, or otherwise - contribute greatly to how we have and continue to perceive both the Middle Ages and the medieval. They reveal something about our relationship with the medieval past (real or imagined) and how it can and does make meaning for us in the present. Medievalism, therefore, analyses not (only) the medieval past, but the effects of modern reinventions of that past. The Medieval Studies Research Group studies the various ways that the Middle Ages is revisited, reconstructed, and represented through the Early Modern era right up to the twenty-first century, via a range of topics, including: the Middle Ages in literature, from Edmund Spenser to Harry Potter and beyond; medieval film, television, and video games; medieval re-enactment groups; engagement with and reception of medieval heritage sites; Arthurian literature and artefacts, both medieval and postmedieval; modern representations of Vikings, Early English and late-medieval cultures; and uses of the Middle Ages in politics and political discourse, including social media.

Inter-Faith Exchanges and Religion | Medieval Studies Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
The Medieval Studies Research Group examines inter-faith exchanges and religion throughout the Middle Ages, with particular attention on the Western Mediterranean world, including: Christian-Muslim relations (600-1500); hagiography and the cult of saints in early medieval Iberia and Gaul; and twelfth-century monasticism.
Christian-Muslim Relations (600-1500)
Our research focuses on Christian-Muslim relations throughout the Middle Ages, within the Iberian Peninsula and the wider Western Mediterranean world. Central to this research is the examination of inter-faith friendship, collaboration (cultural, economic, and political), and diplomacy.
Hagiography and the Cult of Saints
Our research focuses on the cult of saints and Latin hagiography in late antique and early medieval Iberia and Gaul. It also investigates shrine culture, namely the interplay between holy bodies, images, and architecture in Medieval Europe.
Monasticism
Our research focuses on the connections between liturgy and monumental sculpture in the twelfth century. It examines not only the extent to which liturgical readings informed and shaped complex and extended portal programmes, but also the ways monumental images were activated and amplified during liturgical performances.

The Centre for Conservation and Cultural Heritage was formed in 2011 to co-ordinate our research activities in conservation, history and science in relation to the heritage sector. Members share an interest in historic material culture and its conservation and analysis. We have access to science-based methodologies for materials analysis and the historical expertise needed to articulate the significance of this analysis. Members work with the museum sector as conservators, curators and consultants.
The Centre aims to:

Research Themes:
Architectural Paint Research
Lincoln Conservation use the analytical techniques of architectural paint research to provide new primary data about historic interiors. Their research has led to major reassessments of famous decorative schemes across the UK.

Niti Acharya
AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral PhD. Gender, empire and material culture. Women Collectors of South Asia.The British Museum/University of Lincoln
Using the British Museums collections as a starting point, Nitiis focusing on women collectors of South Asian material culture. The research seeks to uncover the role female donors and vendors to the British Museum played in the formation and representation of the empire through their cultural activities. This includes their interactions with people in South Asia in the accumulation of their collections, and also their relationships with museums through their collections.
Niti is a social and community history curator and has researched, developed, and produced more than 50 exhibitions and associated public programmes on a variety of subjects over the last 15 years in a range of London museums. Her focus is on highlighting underrepresented histories through material culture, personal testimonies and public history.
As the Manager of Hackney Museum in Hackney, east London, Niti has investigated the former Ayahs Home nearby and is part-way through a project to identify ayahs entering and leaving the UK based on ship passenger lists from the 1890s to the 1960s. In 2020, she founded an Ayahs and Ammahs international research network which supports those with similar research interests to collaborate across disciplines.

Nicola Meyrick
Thesis Topic: Continuity, martyrdom and assimilation: remaining Christian in Al-Andalus
Nicola is a part-time MPhil/PhD student researching a thesis on the lives and practices of Christians living in the parts of the Iberian peninsula under Muslim rule between 711 and 1085. She is particularly concerned with examining how the boundaries between Christians, Muslims and Jews were maintained and, sometimes, breached. Her approach involves examining liturgical and material evu200bidence as well as written narrative sources and she aims to focus on non-elite Christians as well as their leaders.
Nicola studied for a BA in American History and Politics at Manchester, and then worked for many years at the BBC as a current affairs producer and editor. She took early retirement in 2015 and then did an MA in Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American Studies at Kings College, London. She still has some involvement in journalism and is a trustee of a broadcasting charity. She has seen leaving the BBC as an opportunity to follow her lifelong passion for Spain and formedieval history.



Global and Transregional Studies  | Research | University of LincolnOur Research
The Global and Transregional Studies Research Group (GTS) brings together an inter-disciplinary group of scholars at the College of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities and the University of Lincoln who share research interests in international, transregional, and global studies.
Researchers are increasingly interested in transregional research approaches in history, art/architectural/material history, social and political history, heritage, music, archaeology and the digital heritage, among others. Global comparisons present epistemological challenges that are shared among several disciplines present at the University of Lincoln. Scholars in the group are developing excellent research and publication projects on a wide variety of topics, some of these themes are, for example, Pan-European cultural circulations, the material histories of Asia and Africa, urban and architectural histories of the Caribbean and Latin America, North American histories, histories of architecture in the Global North, and transnational histories of empire, sexuality, gender and political history among others. Our members also explore the histories of race in Britain and the experiences of diaspora communities and their descendants in the UK.
The research group has the largest membership in the College of Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities meets regularly and its activities include a seminar series, group peer-feedback sessions and workshops. The GTS is coordinated byDr Laura Fernndez-Gonzlez from the School of History and Heritage.During the 2022-2023 academic year,Dr Sarah Longair andDr Thomas Bishop will co-convene the research group while Dr Laura Fernndez-Gonzlez is on research leave thanks to a Leverhulme Trust research fellowship.

Imprint Project | Current Projects | University of LincolnAbout the Project
Imprint is an interdisciplinary project, uniting cutting-edge scientific developments with historical methods. It uses forensic examination of hand marks found in the wax on the reverse of medieval seals to carry out historical investigation into what sealing practices tell us about the development of administrative and legal practices, about the rituals involved with exchange and about medieval ideas of identity.
On the forensics side, the study will provide data which is pertinent to on-going areas of research in Identity Science, providing a significant quantity of material from a period long before existing banks of fingerprint data, and contribute to discussions about the uniqueness of fingerprints and their evidential validity.
Medieval seals were the equivalent of modern-day signatures in legal terms, but unlike signatures, the combination of image and text enabled their owners to represent themselves in a certain way. By the fourteenth century men and women across society owned and used seal matrices; some were bespoke and some bought off the shelf  but all were necessary to validate any legal document with which the seals owner was connected.
Now, in the first project of its kind,Imprintwill merge cutting-edge forensic techniques with traditional historical investigation to analyse the fingerprints and palm prints found on the back of wax seals, leading to new discoveries about social constructs and legal practices of the time, as well as provide data which will help current identity science experts. 
Using specialist cameras operated by trained researchers, the fingerprints from around 1,500 seals will be logged on an online database. Those that are viable with be analysed using both tradition methods and forensic software.
From an historical perspective,Imprintwill reveal more about medieval social networks and the bureaucracies and protocols behind authentication and security in medieval England. The results will help to answer questions about administrative, iconographic and legal changes and the performative act of sealing, and how this reflected social and legal relationships.
On the forensics side, the study will contribute important information to current debates in forensics, such as the uniqueness of fingerprints. Through comparing the fingerprints of different demographics at different times  medieval prints and ones from modern society  important statistical information can be gleaned. This information can be built into data regarding the likelihood ratios of finding the same prints on two different people to help advance finger mark identification as a science.
The project is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and led by Dr Philippa Hoskin from the University of Lincoln, with co-investigator Dr Elizabeth New from Aberystwyth University. They will work across five centres; Lincoln Cathedral, Exeter Cathedral, Hereford Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and the National Library of Wales.
For the latest developments, please visit theImprint Project blog.
This project will create an archive of fingerprints and associated detailed information about the seals, which can be incorporated into the catalogues of the five archive repositories involved in the project  Exeter Cathedral, Hereford Cathedral, Lincoln Cathedral, the National Library of Wales and Westminster Abbey.
The methodology used for the three-year project will go on to benefit other repositories with substantial medieval collections which are not directly involved, as they will be able to access information about how their material could be enhanced by employing the same methods used.
The co-investigators will also hold workshops specifically aimed at archival professionals, along with specialist classes for archive students, which will provide cutting-edge skills and knowledge for current curators and the next generation of those caring for sealed documents. These will take place in areas near each of the cathedrals involved in the project.
As the project progresses there will be a website created to document and make searchable, all the data correlated. It will also host online exhibitions of the documents and seals examined, as well as workshops geared towards the general public to offer a vivid insight into medieval life.
s forensic advisers, Forensic Focus, will present the data gathered at conferences and Home Office workshops and training courses. Once the project concludes, the researchers aim to publish its final conclusions in academic journals in their field.", 'Imprint will use cutting-edge forensic techniques, working with Forensic Focus Limited, to identify finger, thumb and palm prints on medieval wax seals, and possibly on parchment as well.
The seals and associated documents will be digitally imaged using a Foster & Freeman Crime Lite Imager. They will be analysed using traditional manual fingerprint comparison as well as digital methods of fingerprint recognition such as Automated Fingerprint Identification Systems (AFIS), which uses mathematical patterns  or algorithms  to identify fingerprints.
In analysing the prints the following forensic aspects will be investigated:
Forensic Focus Limited, based in Ripley, Derbyshire, specialises in fingerprints and forensic quality assurance will provide the finger mark visualisation and fingerprint comparison expertise, as well as forensic knowledge input. Three associates will be allocated to the project and will provide training to the researchers on using the imaging equipment. All are former police personnel with significant experience in the fingerprint and forensic imaging profession.

Entangled Imperial Cities: Architectural Exchange between Lisbon and Old Goa,c.15801640 (British Academy)
This project examines architectural development in Lisbon and Old Goa through the lens of ceremonial entries in the period c. 15801640. During this period, Portugals European capital, Lisbon, and its Asian counterpart, Old Goa, were cosmopolitan centres within the Habsburg global empire. Ceremonial entries had a major impact on the urban development of early modern cities.
Previous analysis (Fernndez-Gonzlez, 2015) indicated that transoceanic comparative study was required for an assessment of the relationship between the triumphal culture and architecture of early modern imperial cities. It is striking that there has been no comparative study on the impact of ceremonial entries on the architectural development of early modern Lisbon and Old Goa.
Entangled Imperial Cities examines buildings, printed sources and archival accounts relating to entries and the built environment in both cities. By making such a comparison, this project intends to shed new light on our understanding of the relationship between centres and peripheries in the first global age.

Formative Spaces  Making Monks in Early Medieval Iberia (BA-Leverhulme Trust)
Formative Spacesis a British Academy-Leverhulme Trust Small Research Grant project that addresses the relationship between physical spaces and normative texts such as monastic rules in the formation of ascetic communities in early medieval Iberia.
Rulebooks for monastic life propose a complicated disciplinary regime that trained monks to adopt specific beliefs and practices, while an increasing number of monastic sites  the spaces in which monks were presumably trained in such practices  have been excavated in Spain and Portugal over recent decades. However, minimal attention has been devoted to understanding how the physical organisation of monastic space related to the rules that regulated ascetic life.
There are two strands to Formative Spaces: (1) a synthetic analysis of a sample of the extant monastic archaeological sites of early medieval Iberia (6th-7th century); (2) a comparison of such sites with contemporary Iberian monastic rules. This scoping study prepares the ground for a fuller examination of the spatiality of monastic formation in early medieval Iberia, and of the relationship between ascetic theory and practice more generally.

Dr Chiara Beccalossi
Sexology, Hormones and Medical Experiments in the Latin Atlantic World: Local Power and International Networks, 1918-1985 (Wellcome Trust Award)
This five-year project investigates how hormone research impacted medical sexual knowledge and how it travelled between Southern Europe and Latin America in the twentieth century. The project focuses on four medical institutes in Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Spain that developed hormone treatments to cure a number of perceived sexual pathologies and normalise individuals.
These institutes collaborated to shape a new medical sexual knowledge, and had mutual exchanges of personnel and scientific techniques. This project aims to understand how hormone research came to play a critical role in the history of medical sexual knowledge; the extent to which endocrinology changed contemporary views of gender and sexuality; and how the global north and the global south have been intertwined in the production of scientific sexual knowledge. This grant also includes a provision for an international public engagement programme,Transitional States: Hormones at the Crossroads of Art and Science.
Working with a number of LGBTIQ organisations, gender clinics, art galleries, a curating team, artists, activists and academics in the UK, Italy and Spain, the programme consists of four video art installations and a number of public debates in Lincoln, London, Barcelona and Bologna. It explores the theme of hormone use and abuse, both in the past and present, and aims to raise awareness about the important impact hormone therapies can have on peoples lives.

Gender and Identity | Medieval Studies Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
The Medieval Studies Research Group examines medieval gender, identity, culture, and society throughout the Middle Ages, notably: the legacy of Rome in Late Antiquity through to the late Middle Ages; medieval literature and culture; the history of women, children, and families; queens, aristocracies, and elites; medieval education and learning; and the history of emotions.
Late Antiquity and the Inheritance of Rome
Throughout the Middle Ages, (medieval) Latin was used as a learned language across Christian Europe, as the language of both the Church and education. Our research focuses on the legacy of Rome in Late Antiquity and beyond, from the sociocultural history of Latin, written law and legal practice, to letter-writing and late antique literary culture. We are also interested in travel and communication in the Mediterranean.
Medieval Text and Literary Culture
Our research examines the literature and culture of the high to late Middle Ages, with particular emphases on monsters, the romance genre and its cultural contexts, and relationships between English and Continental (especially French) romances. Current research explores embodiments of liminality, human-animal relations, and the connections of both the violence in Middle English romance and outlaw narratives, investigating how medieval authors use these texts to challenge or reinstate social hegemonies (or a combination of both).
The History of Women, Children, and Families
The history of women, children, and families has emerged as a growing field of scholarly enquiry over the last forty years. Our research examines the place of women as daughters, wives, mothers and widows with medieval society, and investigates the sexual politics of families, households, and communities in the central and later Middle Ages. It also investigates experiences of childhood and the existence of youth culture in Western Europe.
Queens, Aristocracies, and Elites
s Lives of Royal Women series.", 'Education and Learning
Our research looks at the history of education in the Middle Ages. It investigates the dissemination and transmission of the ideas of the Paris Schools, and the intellectual thought of Peter Lombard and Stephen Langton.
History of Emotions
The history of emotions has emerged as a growing field of scholarly enquiry over the last twenty years. Our research examines the place and use of emotions as a tool for medieval communication and diplomacy throughout the Middle Ages, with particular attention on the role of friendship in cross-cultural communication in the Iberian Peninsula and the medieval Mediterranean world. Current research includes a new project on Emotions, Communication, and Diplomacy in medieval Iberia, which combines historical and literary methodologies to examine the instrumental adoption of emotional discourses across and beyond geopolitical, religious, linguistic, and ethnic frontiers.

Premodern Iberia and Western Mediterranean | Medieval Studies Research Group | University of LincolnOur Research
The Medieval Studies Research Group features the largest cluster of medieval Iberianists in the United Kingdom. Our members examine premodern Iberia and the Western Mediterranean through a wide range of topics, including: the power and authority of Iberian rulers (both Christian and Islamic); economy and society in pre-modern Iberia; the Visigoths and their legacy; and intellectual cultures in pre-modern Iberia.
Power and Authority: Iberian Rulers and Their Subjects
Our research examines the creation, development, and involution of the major Christian and Islamic polities of the Iberian Peninsula, together with the idea and representation of power and authority within these polities. We use a range of source materials (from chronicles to royal diplomas; and from Visigothic votive crowns to Umayyad ivory caskets) to understand the governing technologies available to rulers, as well as the prestige and power that caliphs, kings, and their counsellors presumed to display and deploy.
Economy and Society in Pre-modern Iberia
Medieval Iberia has bequeathed us an astonishing array of documentary and archaeological artefacts with which we can examine the economy and society of this geopolitically complex peninsula. We make use of the increasingly sophisticated insights emerging from urban and rural archaeological contexts to pose new questions of the settlement patterns, living arrangements, and productive strategies of local societies. A longstanding interest in charters underpins much of the research of some of our scholars, widening our knowledge of the multiple contexts in which the written word shaped and expressed the economic concerns of even the most humble members of these societies.
Intellectual Cultures in Pre-modern Iberia: Romans, Visigoths, and Beyond
As Roman rule gave way to Visigothic dominance within the Iberian Peninsula, Hispano-Roman culture remained firmly rooted in the region. Our research focuses on the religious, social, and cultural history of Visigothic Iberia, and the legacy within the Peninsula of both Rome and the Visigoths. We are interested in the writing of history, particularly the works of Isidore of Seville, the production of poetry, including that of Eugenius of Toledo, and in the study and translation of Austrasian and Visigothic letters. We have a special interest in Latin language, literacy, and literature, from late Rome to the high Middle Ages, including the De viris illustribus tradition and Latin Christian bibliography.

Here are just a few examples of research our academic staff are currently involved in:
A [Socially Isolated] Room of Ones Own: Women Writing Lockdown
Principal Investigator: Professor Lucie Armitt
Co-Investigators: Professor Krista Cowman (University of Leicester)
             Professor Sarah Pedersen (Robert Gordon University)
Project Partner:  Liv Tor, artist practitioner
A [Socially Isolated] Room of Ones Own: Women Writing Lockdown is an AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary project, running for 18 months from 1 January 2022- 30thJune 2023. It seeks to investigate womens articulation of their experience of the first phase of lockdown expressed through four key varieties of auto/biographical writings:Published workby professional women writers, including fiction, poetry and writing for children; newly depositedarchival testimoniesin collections such as Mass Observation and the British Library Sound Archive;Online narrativesby bloggers and influencers;Creative workproduced as part of our project partners live workshops (in-person and via Zoom).
The projects major collective output will be an online, free-to-access exhibition,Rooms of Our Own: The Lockdown House.It will be formulated as a House and Garden virtual space that will offer visitors an accessible visual presentation of our main findings. Each room will represent a key aspect of womens experience of lockdown (the home schoolroom; the home office, the new domesticity space of the kitchen; the lockdown garden). The exhibition will be hosted via our purpose-designed project website. In addition to visual representation, the rooms will contain summaries of research findings with links to pages showcasing the fuller work where possible. They will also house the co-production outputs produced as part of the project workshops undertaken by the project partner.
On Growing Old: Womens Late Life Writing 1800-1850
Principal Investigator: Dr Amy Culley
Dr Amy Culley received a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship (2020) and BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grant (2015-) in support of her research project, On Growing Old: Womens Late Life Writing 1800-1850. The research recovers narratives of ageing in journals, correspondence, memoirs, and biographies by early nineteenth-century women in both manuscript and print. These sources provide rare insights into womens ageing in a period in which gender and old age is currently under-researched and that has important legacies for contemporary conceptions of late life. As part of this research, Culley co-convened two international conferences: a British Academy Conference, Narratives of Old Age and Gender (London, 2019) and Narratives of Ageing in the Nineteenth Century (Lincoln, 2019), both of which have resulted in journal special issues (forAge, Culture, Humanities(2021) andJournal of the British Academy(2023)). The research has generated impact through participation in the AHRCs Being Human: A Festival of the Humanities (2016) and the Lincoln Book Festival (2018), a public workshop funded by the British Academy drawing on archival research (2018), and collaborations with Age UK and National Pensioners Convention.
Representing Homelessness
Principal Investigator: Dr Owen Clayton
Dr Owen Clayton received a British Academy Conference Grant to hold a conference onRepresenting Homelessness, which took place at the University of Lincoln in the summer of 2019. The event was distinctive in featuring both scholars and people with experience of homelessness as providing different types of expertise.The conference emphasised the importance of bringing in the voices of homeless people into academic research, including as co-producers of that research.Attendee feedback indicates that the event provided an important platform for speakers with experience of homelessness, and also that it changed the minds of several people with responsibility for homelessness services about needing to take the agency of their clients more into account. The event has also been cited in national media coverage regarding the ongoing campaign to repeal the 1824 Vagrancy Act.The conference led to the publication in 2020 of an edited collection, also calledRepresenting Homelessness, published by Oxford University Press.


Research Groups | University of LincolnIn this section
English Research Groups
s writing and utopian studies. English hosts two vibrant and productive research groups:", 'The Nineteenth Century Research Group
u200cThe Nineteenth-Century Research Group brings together academics to further interdisciplinary inquiry into the history, culture, and literature of the long nineteenth century. The co-chairs regularly organise the longstanding Nineteenth-Century Research Seminar series, in addition to running a new Short Fiction Reading Group.
The group is committed to the benefits of collaborative research, as well as working on individual projects. Issues addressed at group meetings have included celebrity, masculinities, the rural, Digital Humanities, museum cultures, women and theology, and neo-Victorianism  to name a few. We also interrogate the categories set by periodisation and disciplinarity.
Members have organised several conferences at Lincoln, including on the themes of life writing, travel, and ageing, all of which led to published essay collections or journal special issues. The group has pioneered interdisciplinary teaching in the humanities, through the development of research-led MA modules. We have a strong relationship with the Tennyson Research Centre, hosted by Lincolnshire County Council, with whom we collaborate on both teaching and research. The work of the Research Group is particularly (but not exclusively) aligned with the Universitys Heritage Research Theme.
Members regularly obtain funding to pursue research. Recent awards held by members for nineteenth-century projects include a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship and BA/Leverhulme Small Research Grant, as well as a number of Visiting/Library Fellowships (e.g. at Chawton House Library, Houghton Library, Newberry Library, Gladstone Library, American Antiquarian Society, and Winterthur Museum). Members also serve in editorial positions for relevant journals, such as Victoriographies, the William Morris Studies Journal, Gaskell Journal, Gothic Nature, and on the Tennyson Publications Board.
The group fosters connections with academics beyond the University of Lincoln, since we regularly host external speakers from the UK and further afield, as well as welcoming colleagues locally from Bishop Grosseteste University, universities across the Midlands, and independent scholars from the region.
Group members are active on the committee of the British Association for Victorian Studies (BAVS), an international forum which facilitates scholarship in all aspects of the Victorian period, and the Midlands Interdisciplinary Victorian Studies Seminar committee (MIVSS), which unites scholars across the region. Several members are elected Fellows of the Royal Historical Society.
The Nineteenth-Century Research Group has a regular membership of staff and students within the University, as well as a wider membership of external participants. Visitors are also welcome to drop into sessions on an ad hoc basis. Please contactDr Alice CrossleyandDr Laura Gillto be added to the mailing list.
See theNineteenth-Century Research Group Blogfor upcoming events. You can also follow us on Twitter: @19thCLincoln
We have a number of PhD students looking at different periods and aspects of the nineteenth century, and the members of the research group welcome applications for PhD/MPhil study. Please do get in touch with a member if youre interested in studying for a PhD on any aspect of nineteenth-century studies that may be relevant to their research.
As well as staff, PhD students regularly share their research by giving papers at the research seminar series.

The What Happens Now conferences helped to provide a forum  and give shape to an emerging community of contemporary literary studies scholars and was expanded into the international, biennial BACLS conference (2016-20). In recognition of Lincolns role in setting up this international conference, the BACLS-What Happens Now conference series includes a keynote Lincoln Lecture as part of its proceedings.
Research produced and disseminated by group members has led to a monograph (Brexlit: British Literature and the European Project, Bloomsbury, 2021) and edited collections on Sir Kazuo Ishiguro and Hari Kunzru (21st Century Fictions series, Manchester University Press). The group has also pioneered interdisciplinary teaching in the Humanities through the development of research-led MA modules on the revalidated MA English Literature programme. We have a number of PhD students looking at different aspects of the twenty-first century, and welcome applications for PhD/MRes study.
Group organisers are also leading members of the College Equality, Diversity and Inclusion committee, which works towards enhancing inclusive teaching, research and engagement activity at Lincoln.
