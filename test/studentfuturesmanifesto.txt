Hear from Our Student Consultants and Staff Mentors
Each of our student consultants were interviewed for their specialised theme and showed a passion for bringing improvements to student life, confidence, academic progress, and their social skills. One consultant was recruited for each of the project themes.
 Union's Vice President Education and Group Deputy Chief Executive, with a University staff member, the Dean of the Lincoln Academy of Learning and Teaching (LALT) also on the appointment panel. The student consultants were supported institutionally through LALT, with recruitment and training being provided by the Students' Union. To assist student consultants in their role, a suite of support and training was established to guide them, emphasising the commitment of the University to work in partnership with the Students' Union, with a focus on enhancing student experiences.", 'Grace Smith
"Thank you for providing this opportunity, I have gained so many skills and experiences from it and I hope our recommendations come together to improve the student experience!"
What did you learn from being a student consultant?
"I learnt some great interview skills in the hiring process, and then I developed my report writing skills in putting the final piece together, as well as my public engagement skills in terms of gaining feedback. This is only a few things, but the list could go on for a really long time as it is a very enriching experience!
"My staff mentors really helped me see experiences from a view which is not my own and helped me develop my ideas throughout the process. These skills, particularly seeing things from a different viewpoint, will be very beneficial in my next career steps."

"As a student consultant, I gained an understanding of the complexities and nuances involved in higher education, particularly in terms of aligning teaching methods with student expectations."
What did you learn from being a student consultant?
"As a student consultant, I gained an understanding of the complexities and nuances involved in higher education, particularly in terms of aligning teaching methods with student expectations. This experience underscored the significance of working collaboratively with both students and academic faculty to co-create solutions that elevate the quality of the educational experience. Additionally, I learned the importance of effective communication in presenting findings and recommendations to stakeholder."Working with my staff mentor, I honed my stakeholder engagement, critical thinking, and presentation skills which are valuable and will contribute to my effectiveness in managing projects, consulting, and managing stakeholders in my career."
s experience in an inclusive way, irrespective of their background, was truly inspiring. This just emphasises the power of co-creation and reminds us all that students and staff working in genuine partnership yields powerful results for everybody.", 'Jo Rushworth

"We had to learn a lot for this role, we needed good communication with staff and colleges, as well as to be able to talk to students and be able to listen while conducting interviews to get to the bottom of their issues."
What did you learn from being a student consultant?
"One of the most important skills was organisation and communication, with bi-weekly meetings and making sure reports were updated. We had to combine two different perspectives along with research we built up over the weeks together to make the report. This has given me a great experience dealing with different people with different ideas it also helped critical thinking. Lastly, it helped to develop my documentation skills through having to keep notes meetings, storing research from multiple sources, and displaying it in a way so everyone can understand, which is key if I want to tackle bigger projects in life."
Our student consultant provided excellent insight on what we are missing from a careers service, the specific proposals around engagement have been really helpful as some of the recommendations are changes we are already making. It has given the service confidence that these specific changes were the right ones to make.

"Working as a student consultant helped me further develop my understanding of the University and how the system works both inside and outside the curriculum."
What did you learn from being a student consultant?
"I feel as a student consultant I was able to learn more about the different departments within the University. It was interesting as I was able to witness the unity between all departments and the enthusiasm to wanting to improve the student experience.
"Working as a student consultant helped me further develop my understanding of the University and how the system works both inside and outside the curriculum. As someone who is interested in medical education and university experiences, I feel like this understanding will help me be able to identify any strengths or weaknesses in the future, when I am hopefully working in medical education. I believe this will be a great skill to have so that I can one day make improvements and changes to the medical education system."
It was great to work with the students on this project and get fresh insights and ideas about what we can do to enhance the digital student experience. I hope its an initiative that will be repeated as it really has been valuable to us in Digital Services.

Student Futures Manifesto | About the University | University of LincolnStudent Futures Manifesto
Creating a Sense of Belonging for Our Students
The Student Futures Manifesto aims to create a set of actions and commitments to enhance the student experience at the University of Lincoln. The project has built upon the work of the UPP Student Futures Commission, which identified a baseline of students who had low confidence, who were potentially behind in academic progress, and had increased anxiety and a loss of social skills following the Covid-19 pandemic. The Commission wanted to increase support for students, to help prepare them for successful careers.
The Commission argued for a move towards knowledge economy values being central in institutions, with environments that are built in partnership with students. This practice emphasises the move towards physical and digital spaces, an environment that promotes learning over teaching, and fosters a model of co-creation, creating community, rather than surface level engagement. The project outlined six key themes in which to strive for development. The Student Futures Manifesto is guided by these themes to best support students and develop provision for the future. The Manifesto aims to commit to the actions outlined in the final report and develop a communications strategy to champion the work done. The University of Lincoln aims to deliver on these commitments within five years.
 sense of belonging following the Covid-19 pandemic.", "Based upon six key themes, the manifesto is a commitment to enhance and create a series of support mechanisms with the aim of making positive contributions to the student experience. The manifesto commitment is student led and owned, from start to finish, and is firmly established as a collaborative process, supplementing the University's partnership approaches with student engagement.", ' Student Futures Commission Website
Our Student Consultants
Six student consultants were recruited to champion and lead the Student Futures Manifesto project at the University of Lincoln. The role of each student was to act as a consultant to develop a student manifesto that commits to improvements in the six overarching themes, with the aim of improving the academic, social, and progression opportunities within the University of Lincoln. Each student interviewed for their specialised theme and showed a passion for bringing improvements to student life, confidence, academic progress, and their social skills.

Working with my student consultant gave me greater insight into the student experience and allowed me to see and appreciate how a student views the way in which we promote support services across the University.

Project Recommendations
Our student consultants have provided a range of recommendations for each of the themes identified by the work of the UPP Foundation. These recommendations were informed by the data collected during the project, and provide guidance on where our student population want the University to commit to targeted development. These developments should empower the values of community, ensure digital learning enables wellbeing and social development, and embody the knowledge economy. For each of the overarching themes, the commitments and actions are proposed.
Full Project Report
You can now download and read the full report on the final recommendation of the project. The next steps are for task and finish groups to be created to progress with actions and operationalise the findings of the project.
Summary of Key Recommendations
Summer Microcredential Programmes
To create a series of microcredential programmes to allow prospective and incoming students to build up their understanding of the expected knowledge, identify gaps in this knowledge, and potentially allow academic staff to establish a baseline of academic knowledge of a cohort.
Information Hubs
s website with links to student life, course pages, students union, online prospectus, and official University social media accounts.", 'Open Day and Offer Holder Days Materials
To provide further information, in the form of a booklet for each course/School containing further information regarding course structure, nature of study, and assessments. These would ideally be a physical document with an online version available.
Create Opportunities for Inter-year Conversations
Provide an opportunity within Welcome Week for students to meet and informally chat with students about their own experiences so that students have another way to ask questions.
Providing a Wider Range of Signposting During Welcome Week
Ensure that resources provided during Welcome Week are accessible all year round, so students are able to appropriately access the resource they need easily.
Offering Extra-curricular Opportunities to Explore Campus
Students should complete a project within their first week in the form of a scavenger hunt, which would help them orientate themselves around the University and provide them with necessary knowledge about what support is available.
Mental Health Self-certification For Extensions
To reinstate self-certification for extensions in the 2023/24 academic year. This would support students in need of additional time due to mental health conditions and concerns.
Improved Communication Channels
Channels of communication need to be developed when advertising services or supporting students who have reached out for help. Students need to be made more aware of the services available to them as they start their university experience in their first year of study.
Information on Wellbeing Support in Welcome Week
All new students during Welcome Week need to be made aware of the support offered by the Wellbeing Centre and how to contact them.
Improved Clarity of Teaching Methods
The flipped classroom is an instructional approach that typically involves students engaging with pre-recorded lectures or materials before the class session, allowing for more interactive and collaborative activities during in-person class time. It encourages active learning, student engagement, and peer-to-peer interaction. It is also key to ensure students are well-informed about the available teaching methods and their benefits, and it is recommended to improve communication and resources regarding teaching approaches.
How and When Students Find Information about Teaching Methods
Enhance information provision to improve the clarity and depth of information provided to prospective students during the decision-making process, particularly regarding teaching methods, expectations, and make the learning curve a bit easier.
Assess the Level of Preparedness for Teaching Methods and How This Benefits the Learning Experience
To address the desire for more practical sessions, The University of Lincoln should focus on integrating hands-on experiences and real-world applications into learning experience. This can include incorporating case studies, simulations, or collaborative projects.
Increasing Student Participation Through Incentives
This has been a key area that was highlighted in the focus group, and evident with the low number of responses to the survey. There is uncertainty as to why student engagement and participation is low when opportunities are given. Suggested solutions could be through the use of incentives to encourage participation.
Student Curriculum Groups
Student-led groups within the curriculum to enable collaboration between staff and students and truly ensure learning has a student-focused approach, supporting students to achieve the best outcomes.
Increased Exposure of Opportunities within the Curriculum that Help Build Skills, Networks, and Communities
Based on the survey results and comments made in the focus group, students are either not aware of opportunities or feel as though they are unable to participate. A recommendation to provide more exposure of these within the curriculum is to have College-specific announcements released monthly, so thatstudents are aware of what is available.
Microcredentials
Training opportunities to be offered to students alongside their degree to support them in their future careers. This could include academic skill support such AWS training for business students, Excel, and Word certificates. Non-academic skills could include first aid training, British Sign Language, formal writing, or team-working and confidence building courses.
Integrations
To integrate careers and employability further into teaching with courses and modules to take career readiness seriously and better prepare their students for the future.
Engagement
Ensure that students know what activities and services are offered and how they can get access to them. This could include featuring these events within student timetables.

The Manifesto aims to commit to the actions outlined in the final report and develop a communications strategy to champion the work done. The University of Lincoln aims to deliver on these commitments within five years.
