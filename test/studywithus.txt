We encourage you to read the information on this page carefully before you travel to campus and to let us know if you have any questions. We look forward to meeting you soon.
Planning Your Arrival
As part of your preparations for travelling to the UK, you will need to think carefully about what to pack in your suitcase and what to bring with you. It is also important to think about what is necessary, as the space in your suitcase will be limited and it may be easier to buy items such as toiletries and cooking equipment when you arrive in Lincoln.
As part of your hand luggage, it is important that you include essential documents which you maybe asked to provide at the border when you arrive in the UK. These include:
There are certain goods that passengers are not allowed to bring into the UK. Detailed information regarding what you can and cannot bring to the UK can be found on theUK Government website.


You will need to arrive at the University of Lincoln before the start of Welcome Week on Monday 20 May 2024.
Your course induction will take place during Welcome Week and there will be a number of compulsory sessions that you will need to attend on campus. There will also be a variety of optional talks, activities, and events, to help you connect with fellow students and settle in at Lincoln.
Details about September 2024 Welcome Week will be released shortly - please check back.

Before you ArriveBefore you travel to the UK you must ensure you have arranged suitable accommodation, and that you are able to move into your room when you arrive. Arranging your accommodation prior to travelling to the UK is very important, as finding accommodation on the day you arrive could be very expensive, and there may not be any availability nearby campus.We recommend contacting your accommodation provider before you begin your journey to let them know your expected arrival time, and to discuss how to collect your keys. You should also ask your accommodation provider to confirm what items are in your room. This will help you to plan ahead and to create a list of essential items you may need to buy when you arrive, such as a duvet or cutlery etc.Living Away from CampusIf you are planning to live outside of campus, you will need to research how you will travel to the University on a regular basis and how much this will cost. This is important as your timetable may include classes that you must attend on campus up to five days each week.
If you hold a Student Visa, having a high level of attendance and engagement is very important and you will be expected to take part in all timetabled classes. Failure to maintain a high level of attendance will place your visa at risk and could also affect your eligibility to apply for the Graduate Route at the end of your course. Further information regarding privately rented accommodation and living away from campus can be found here.

To request a CAS you will need to: - Hold an unconditional offer from the University of Lincoln
- Have paid your tuition fee deposit. The amount will be outlined in your offer letter and does not apply to Pre-sessional English and Academic Study Skills (PEASS) Courses
- Complete the online CAS request form by logging into the University's online application system, OneUni. Once you have logged in using your applicant ID number and password, please click on the 'My Details' function in the 'Forms' tab.
Please note: if you pay any further fees after your CAS has been issued, please do not request that your CAS be updated. Instead you should submit official proof of your payment with your visa application. 
Deposit Payment and CAS Request Deadlines
We will be updating the CAS request deadlines for September 2024 entry in the coming months.
We strongly encourage applicants to complete the deposit payment and CAS request process as soon as they are eligible to do so. This will help to ensure you have sufficient time to apply for your visa and to arrive in the UK before the start of your studies. Please note that you may also be required to clear a pre-CAS interview before being issued with your CAS. Before you pay your deposit and complete the CAS request form, please visit the UK Government website to find out more information regarding the different types of visa services that may be available and the cost. It is important that you also carefully check the visa processing times in the country you are applying from.
Document Verification
Once you have submitted your CAS request, the International Admissions Team will carry out final checks on the documents you have provided to ensure that they meet UKVI, as well as University, requirements. If additional information is requested, please ensure that you provide this as quickly as possible to enable the International Admissions Team to assess your eligibility for a CAS.As part of the application and CAS issuing process, the International Admissions team may ask you to consent to having your academic documents verified.You will be asked to provide written consent.
How are documents verified?
The verification is carried out by QCAS  Qualification Checked At Source, in association with Qualification Check. Once you have provided written consent, your transcript and certificate will be uploaded to the QCAS portal and QCAS will contact your institution directly for verification.
How long does verification take?
This really depends on how long it takes for your institution to respond to the request from QCAS. The average is 7-10 working days.
What happens if I do not wish to give my consent?
If you do not wish to consent to having your documents verified, you can inform the International Admissions team and the team will withdraw your application. If you have paid a CAS deposit, the University of Lincolns Admissions Terms and Conditions give details of the Universitys refund policy,
Prepare Your Financial Evidence
As part of your visa application, you will need to show evidence that you have sufficient funds to cover the cost of the first year of your course, or the whole course if it is less than 12 months long. You will also be required to show that you have enough funds to cover your living costs such as food and accommodation  this is often referred to as maintenance by the UK Home Office.
The amount of money you need to show for your living costs is currently 1,023 per month of your course, up to a maximum of 9 months. If you are bringing dependants such as a partner or child with you to the UK, you will need to show an additional 680 a month for each of them, up to a maximum of 6,180.
The above amounts are set by the UK Government and are subject to change, so it is important that you carefully check the most up-to-date information prior to submitting your application.
If you are self-funding, you will need to provide evidence that you have held the required amount of money for at least 28 consecutive days before the date of your visa application. This will usually be in the form of a bank statement, or a letter from your bank. Detailed information regarding acceptable forms of evidence can be found by reading the Student Visa policy guidance document on the UK Government website.
Your bank statement must be in your name, or in one or both of your parents or guardians names. You can use more than one bank account if you wish.
If you use a parents bank account as evidence, you must also provide a birth certificate or household register showing the relationship between you and a letter from your parent giving you permission to use the money in the account. If your funds are not in British pounds (GBP) then you should use the OANDA currency converter to show how much your money is worth on the date of your visa application.
Sponsored Students
If you have an official financial sponsor, you will be required to provide a letter from your sponsor confirming this. If your sponsor is not covering all your maintenance requirements, you must show that you have the remaining funds yourself (see above). Further information regarding who can be an official financial sponsor and the details they must provide can be found by reading the Student Visa policy guidance.
Prepare Your Supporting Documents
In addition to preparing your financial evidence, you will also be required to submit supporting documents. This includes:
Additional supporting documents that maybe required include:
Depending on your country of residence, you may be required to have a tuberculosis (TB) test. Further information regarding TB tests can be found on the UK Governments Tuberculosis tests for visa applicants page.
It is important that your supporting documents are originals as copies are not accepted. If the documents are not in English or Welsh, you will be required to provide an official translation.
Complete Visa Application Form and Attend Your Appointment
After you have prepared your supporting documents and financial evidence, you will need to complete a Student visa application. As part of your application, you will be required to pay a visa fee in addition to the Immigration Health Surcharge.
You can apply for your visa no more than 3 months before your course start date, and no more than 6 months after you get your CAS. The time it takes to process visa applications can vary so we recommend that you visit the UK Government website to see how long this is likely to take.
As part of the online visa application, you will be required to book an appointment to attend a Visa Application Centre in order to submit your documents. You will also be required to have your biometric information taken such as your fingerprints and a photograph. You may also be asked to attend a Credibility Interview.
After your Visa Application Centre appointment, you will receive a decision letter from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) regarding the status of your visa application. If your application has been approved, you will be issued with a visa sticker (called a vignette) in your passport. The vignette will be valid for 30 days to enable you to travel to the UK. It is important that you carefully check that your details are correct on the vignette and your decision letter as soon as you receive it.
Credibility Interviews
As part of your visa application, you may be asked to attend a credibility interview to ensure that you intend to travel to the UK for genuine reasons. Interviews may take place face-to-face, by telephone or via a video link, and you must attend if asked to do so or your visa application could be rejected.
If you are called for an interview, you may be asked questions about:
The interviews may take place face-to-face or by telephone or via a video link. If you are asked to attend an interview, you must do so. If you do not attend without providing a reasonable explanation this will result in your visa application being rejected.
Arrive in the UK and Collect Your BRP Card
Once you have received your visa, you will need to arrange your travel to the UK and ensure you arrive in Lincoln by the start date displayed on your Confirmation of Acceptance of Study (CAS) document.
When you arrive in the UK, you will be required to show the vignette and your decision letter (mentioned in step 4) to immigration officials at the border.
Your visa information will be printed on a Biometric Residence Permit (BRP) card. This must be collected from the Post Office that you selected on your visa application form within 10 days of arriving in the UK. Once you have collected your BRP card, it is important that you check the information is correct, we also advise you to keep a scanned copy of the card and keep it safe at all times. You will need to bring your BRP card to the University alongside your other documents to be copied.
To help you prepare for your travel to the UK, our pre-departure webpages contain lots of helpful information and advice, including details of our free airport pick-up service from London Heathrow Airport.
Declaring Previous Visa Refusals When Submitting Your Application
Please ensure that you inform us of any visa refusals that you have previously received when you submit your application, and provide a copy of your refusal document(s). Please note that this requirement is not limited to refusals for the UK.
If you subsequently submit a CAS request form, the refusal documentation will be assessed in order to determine whether the University is able to issue you with a CAS.
If you have previously had a visa refused on credibility grounds, or because it was claimed that you had provided fraudulent documents, it is unlikely that the University will be able to issue you with a CAS. However, if you successfully appealed the refusal decision, then the University may approve your CAS request.
As stated in the UniversitysStudent Admissions Terms and Conditions (PDF), if it is discovered that your application contains material inaccuracies or fraudulent information, or that significant information has been omitted from your application form (for example, previous visa refusals), the University may withdraw or amend your Offer, or terminate your registration at the University. In such circumstances, any deposit paid by you will be retained by the University.
Part-time Student Visa
The UK Home Office permits universities to sponsor postgraduate students to study a part-time programme in the UK, subject to meeting all eligibility criteria.
Whilst the UK Home Office offers a part-time study route, the University of Lincoln have decided not to sponsor visas for students wishing to study a part-time programme. When this route was launched the University thoroughly considered the requirements and conditions of the route and felt that it is very restrictive for students.
When studying on a part time programme with this visa:
If you are currently enrolled with us and wish to switch to part-time study, the University may consider this on an exceptional case-by-case basis. Please note that you would be required to apply for a new visa to move to a part-time programme.
If you believe this is an option you would like to consider please contact the International Advice Team by email at internationaladvice@lincoln.ac.uk in the first instance. You can also email visaextension@lincoln.ac.uk for information about how to apply for the new visa if your request is approved.
Requesting a Refund of Your CAS Deposit
If you find yourself unable to enrol at the University because your visa application has been unsuccessful, it may be possible to receive a refund of your CAS deposit.
TheStudent Admissions Terms and Conditions explain the circumstances in which your CAS deposit can be refunded.
In the first instance, you will need to email a copy of your visa refusal document to the International Admissions Team  intadmissions@lincoln.ac.uk  and confirm that you would like your circumstances to be assessed for a CAS deposit refund.
Can We Help?
The University of Lincolns International Advice team is here to help answer any questions or queries you may have about the visa application process.

The Government's 'Find an Apprenticeship' website lists the largest number of vacancies available throughout England.
Company Websites
Many organisations will advertise through their own websites. If there is a company you would like to work for, visit their website to see if they offer apprenticeships.
Apply and Get a Job
The application process for apprenticeships varies by employer, but most usually involve a covering letter and CV. You may also be invited to an assessment centre an event where you will be asked to work on your own or in teams on a variety of tasks. There may also be a final interview.
University Enrolment
If you are successful, you will then need to complete your University application and enrol on the relevant course. Apprenticeships usually start with an induction, where you will get to know other people on the programme and begin your first taught sessions.

Microplastic Contamination as a Threat to Human Health
Supervisory Team:Prof Jeanette Rotchell
This PhD aims to firstly examine the presence, distribution, levels, types, and targeted impacts of microplastics within the human body. A second aim is to relate the findings to a mathematical modelling approach to predict the distribution of microplastics within the body.
It is already established that microplastics are present in many tissues within the body and our earlier work has produced datasets for human lung, blood, and urine. Previous studies have focused on specific tissue types, have used a variety of isolation and characterisation techniques, and this has resulted in a patchwork of datasets. This study will take a holistic approach and use three commonly adopted microplastic characterisation techniques available at the University of Lincoln; micro-FTIR, Raman and SEM, to calibrate the findings. The techniques will allow polymer, size and shape characterisation which can inform the subsequent stage of biological effects investigation.
The second element involves mathematical modelling to explore the possibility of predicting microplastic particle fate within the body based on their properties and the size dimensions of the various transport systems within the body.
Training and Development
The successful candidate will receive comprehensive research training including technical, personal and professional skills.
All researchers at University of Lincoln are part of the Doctoral College and College of Health and Science wider postgraduate community, which provides support with high quality training and career development opportunities.
Funding
A tax-free stipend of ca. 18,622 p.a. (in monthly instalments). The fees are 4,712.
Entry requirements for applicants to PhD

Implementation of GPU-accelerated simulations for real time propagated excited states and applications to organometallic photochemistry
Supervisors:Professor Matt Watkins, School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Lincoln and Dr Joshua Elliott & Dr Sofia Diaz-Moreno, Department of Physical Science, Diamond Light Source Ltd.
4-year Fully Funded PhD Studentship developing real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations of photoactive organometallic compounds.
Diamond Light Sourceis the UKs national synchrotron science facility. By accelerating electrons to near light-speed, Diamond generates brilliant beams of light from infra-red to X-rays which are used for academic and industry research and development across a range of scientific disciplines including structural biology, physics, chemistry, materials science, engineering, earth and environmental sciences.
Summary
Applications are welcome for a four-year funded PhD studentship jointly held at the School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Lincoln and the Spectroscopy Group at Diamond Light Source starting October 2023. The Studentship will focus on developing GPU parallelised routines for Real-Time Propagated Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory with the Open Source CP2K software and their application to Pump and Probe spectroscopy data collected at the I18 Microfocus beamline.
Background
Understanding, on an atomic scale, how light-activated processes drive chemical reaction mechanisms, local geometric rearrangements and charge transfer reactions will be pivotal in engineering next-generation devices and overcoming our overreliance on carbon-positive technology. X-ray pump and probe spectroscopy is a critical tool for probing light-induced reaction mechanisms and photo-excited states. However, this type of experiment typically provides data of seldom observed chemical states and therefore, further analysis and characterisation can be highly challenging.
First-principles simulations can be focal in interpreting experimental spectroscopic data collected at Diamond Light Source. Real-Time Propagation Time-Dependent DFT has emerged as a powerful and viable means to investigate the time evolution of excited states subject to a time-dependent electromagnetic field.
Project Description
The studentship targets the acceleration of the RTP-TDDFT routines within the CP2K code through GPU parallelisation. RTP-TDDFT will be deployed to provide insight into the fundamental dynamical excited state properties of organo-transition metal complexes of particular interest to the facilities user communities. In addition, it will implement an automated framework for RTP-TDDFT simulations of more generalised materials across different High-Performance Computing facilities available to Diamond Light Source scientists and users.
Further Information
Diamond Light Source Ltd holds an Athena SWAN Bronze Award, demonstrating their commitment to provide equal opportunities and to advance the representation of women in STEM/M subjects: science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine.
How to Apply
We seek a highly motivated student interested in research software development and materials science to join our team. Interested applicants are asked to provide an up-to-date CV and a one to two page cover letter outlining their scientific background, expertise and research interests and the names ad contact details of two references toJoshua.elliott@diamond.ac.ukandMWatkins@lincoln.ac.uk. Informal enquiries are also encouraged.
The position will remain open until a suitable candidate is found.

Funding and Levy | Information for Employers | University of LincolnFunding an Apprenticeship
Employers can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training and assessment. The funding you are eligible for is determined by the number of people you employ, the annual payroll of your company, and the age of the apprentices you employ.
Large Employers
Organisationswith a wage bill above 3 million are able to use their apprenticeship levy contributions to pay for the cost of tuition fees. Levy payments will be 0.5 per cent of your total wage bill, minus a 15,000 levy allowance. Those payments - and a 10 per cent government top-up - will fund apprenticeship course fees and any end-point assessment, up to the relevant funding cap.
Employers who do not have sufficient levy payments to cover the full cost of tuition fees, will also be eligible for the 95 per cent government funding. You can find out more about the Apprenticeship Levy on the GOV.UK website. Find out More
Small Employers
Smaller employers, who do not pay the apprenticeship levy, share the cost of training and assessing their apprentices with the government; this is called co-investment. For new apprenticeships you pay 5% towards the cost of apprenticeship training. The government will pay the rest (95%) up to the funding band maximum. Find out More
Additional Support
Small businesses with fewer than 50 employees hiring an apprentice under 19-years-of-age when the apprenticeship commenceswill pay no tuition fees at all.
All businesses employing an apprentice under 19-years-of-age, a care leaver up to 24-years-of-age, or an adult with additional needs will qualify for an extra support payment of1,000.
Further Information
You can find out more about the costs of hiring an apprentice on the dedicated employers section of the apprenticeships.gov.uk website.
Contact Us
If you have an enquiry or if you wish to have an informal discussion about our apprenticeship programmes please contact us.
Employers are encouraged to use the Government's Recruit an Apprentice tool at https://www.gov.uk/recruit-apprentice to post vacancies and manage applications for apprenticeships.

Understanding your Offer | University of LincolnIn this section
Understanding Your Offer
Congratulations on receiving your offer to study here at the University of Lincoln. This page explains what your offer means and what you will need to do next.
Conditional' or 'Unconditional'.", 'Your offer will be conditional if you still have exams to take, we require verification of your qualifications or if you have to meet non-academic requirements (for example, English language proficiency). Your offer conditions will be listed in your offer and you will need to meet these before you can request a CAS or enrol on your course.
An unconditional offer means that you have already met the University of Lincolns entry requirements for your course and have provided all necessary documents for your application to be assessed.
The next step will be for you to log-in to your online application account to accept your offer and, if your offer is conditional, upload the required documents to meet the conditions of your offer.
UCAS Applicants  to reply to your offer, please log-in to your UCAS Track account. For further guidance, please see the Replying to Your Offer section of our Offer Guide.
In order to enrol on a course at the University of Lincoln, you will need to demonstrate that you have the required level of English language proficiency, even if you consider English to be your main language (this is also the case for Home students).
Please see our full list of acceptable English language qualifications for more details.
The Universitys English Language Centre offers a range of Pre-Sessional English and Academic Study Skills (PEASS) courses to help offer holders prepare for their studies. Full details of the courses available, and their entry requirements, are explained on our PEASS page.

Academic progression forms an important part of the Student Visa system. Usually, in order to apply for a new course from inside the UK, you must have successfully completed the course for which you were previously issued a Student/Tier 4 visa and be applying to study a course at a higher level.
A student may be permitted to study a second course at the same level as their previous course, but only:
In addition, one of the following must apply:
In order to assess whether an application to study a further course at the same level meets these strict academic progression requirements, you will be asked to provide a progression statement.
The statement should explain your reasons for applying to study the additional course and explain how it meets the requirements set out above. You will need to draw on the course content, detailed on the course information page, to make a strong case.
The statement must be written in your own words. If it is found that the statement contains content copied from the Internet, your application will be unsuccessful.
If the statement is not satisfactory, the International Admissions Team will unfortunately not be able to issue you with a CAS to make a new visa application from inside the UK, as your visa application will not represent academic progression.
The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) applies to all international students (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects. These students must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before they can study in the UK. If students are applying to study an undergraduate course with an integrated masters year, ATAS clearance may also be required.
Find out more about ATAS
How to apply
If you have applied and received an offer for a course that requires ATAS approval, one of your offer conditions will be to obtain an ATAS certificate. We will also give you the CAH3 code for your course and a link to the ATAS guidance on the GOV.UK website.
You should apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate online.
When to apply
You can apply for an ATAS certificate up to nine months before the start date of your course. An ATAS certificate is valid for six months from the date of issue and must be in-date when you enrol.
Please note that we cannot issue you with an unconditional offer, or CAS, until you have received ATAS clearance and the International Admissions Team has received a copy of your ATAS certificate.
Documents and information required to apply
To apply online you will need:
You will also need to provide information on:
Additional information for research degrees
Research students will also need to enter some information about their proposed area of research. This should be at least 5-6 lines in length and agreed with your PhD supervisor in writing before you make your ATAS application.
How long will it take?
You should allow at least four weeks (20 working days) for the application process. Processing times will increase between the months of April and September and can take 30 or more working days to complete.
To ensure fairness and consistency, there is no fast track service, and the University is unable to intervene in an ATAS application. You should therefore submit you ATAS application as early as possible, however please note that you will be unable to enrol if your ATAS certificate has expired.
If you are a self-funding student and require a Student Visa to study in the UK, you will be required to a pay a 5,000 CAS deposit. The deposit should be paid after you have accepted an unconditional offer and before you submit a CAS request form. Details of how to pay can be found on the Paying Your Tuition Fees page of the Universitys website.
Requesting a refund of CAS deposit due to unsuccessful visa application
If you find yourself unable to enrol at the University because your visa application has been unsuccessful, it may be possible to receive a refund of your CAS deposit.
The Student Admissions Terms and Conditions explain the circumstances in which your CAS deposit can be refunded.
In the first instance, you will need to email a copy of your visa refusal document to the International Admissions team  intadmissions@lincoln.ac.uk  and confirm that you would like your circumstances to be assessed for a CAS deposit refund.
As part of your offer, you may be asked to provide copies of your official academic certificates and transcripts.
Documents displaying incorrect information, such as name or date of birth, cannot be accepted. If your documents have errors, please contact the awarding institution to request that these be corrected. Please note that we are unable to accept affidavits attesting to errors in documents or to name changes.
If your original degree certificate, academic transcript or other relevant documents are not in English you must provide an officially certified translation.
Your certified translations must be provided either by:
If the translation is not provided by the awarding institution we will also ask you to provide:
If you are relying on a Bachelors, Masters or PhD award completed in a majority English-speaking country as proof of your English language ability, and are not a national of one of these countries, you will be required to obtain a UK ENIC Statement of Comparability and this will form one of your offer conditions.
You will need to send a copy of your Statement to the International Admissions Team and must submit the original Statement with your visa application.

As part of your application, you will be required to provide a personal statement. This is your opportunity to tell us why you are applying to study your chosen course. It is also important that you include:
When writing your personal statement, please make sure that you refer to the course information page on the Universitys website as this contains details of course content, entry requirements and career opportunities for successful graduates.
It is important that the statement is written in your own words. If it is found that parts of your statement have been copied from the Internet, or that your statement does not sufficiently cover the points listed above, you may be given one opportunity to re-write your statement. If your amended statement still contains plagiarism, or does not explain why you wish to study your chosen course in the UK, your application will be made unsuccessful.
Postgraduate Applications
Applicants pursuing postgraduate level courses can either accept or decline their offer. They can do this using the University of Lincoln online application system, or, if the application was made through an agent or partner, by emailing the International Admissions Team at intadmissions@lincoln.ac.uk.
Can I defer my offer?
Applicants who require a Student visa will not usually be permitted to defer their course offer, however they may re-apply to the University for the relevant academic session.A deferral request may be exceptionally considered where an applicant has firmly accepted an unconditional offer and paid the CAS deposit by the stipulated deadline. In such cases, the deposit must have reached the Universitys account by the advertised CAS request deadline.For further information, please see the UniversitysCAS Issuance Policy.

Food Insights and Sustainability | Flexible Learning | University of LincolnKey Information
Contact Information:Tel:01406 493000Email:ncfm@lincoln.ac.ukEnquire By EmailCourse Overview
This one half day course provides an overview of current issues in the food and beverage system that are going to transform business practices. The focus of this short course is applying the sustainability and circular economy sciences in food and beverage businesses.
Making Sure Resources in Your Business Are Utilised More Effectively.
All business practice must start by understanding your consumer and todays consumers are asking far more of our food and beverage companies. These demands include no plastic packaging, net zero greenhouse gas emissions, healthier indulgent foods, and they must align with the quality, environmental, and safety systems we are already working with.
We Must Do More; and We Need to Eat, Drink and Be Ready.
This course aims to enable you to be more innovative in strategy rather than following the media and innovate your own agenda so that responses are creative rather than reactive. This is a contrary and puzzling arena at times. The demands for greater safety but less packaged; or, more diverse produce but with less food miles; or even, greater quality but lower price, trade off place increased pressures on businesses in a world dominated by consumer and social media.
Content
How to Measure Sustainability
As well as describing the established LCA and resource footprint methods we will show you how to work out resource and carbon footprinting of your products. Measuring sustainability and circular economy depends on data and we will show you how to access databases that can help you to guide businesses so that they can make claims associated with sustainable actions.
"If you cant measure, you cant manage. We know you can manage but we will show you new ways of measuring."
Mapping Resource Flows for Business Sustainability
Understanding supply chains and where location data can be obtained will transform how claims of sustainability, provenance, or circular economy are made. We will show you how these approaches can be used for distribution, wholesale, and storage operations.
"If you know where everything is, you need to know where it is going. We know you know this, but we will show you knowing how it is used can transform your practice."
Communicating Sustainability
Understanding media and cues that will be of interest to your consumers is as important as the claim. We will show you how to develop key messages for your business and direct you to databases that can transform business practice.
"If you cant communicate with your customer, it is not only sustainability that will not work."
Delivery
This half day course is delivered on site at The National Centre for Food Manufacturing, Holbeach and can also be delivered on business premises.

What is a microcredential?
A microcredential is a short, certification-style course that focuses on a specific topic or skill that is designed to help learners gain or update their knowledge and abilities in a particular industry or profession in a short period of time. Microcredentials usually take between 10-12 weeks for a 10-credit course or 5-7 weeks for a 5-credit course to complete. They are often delivered online and can be completed at the learners own pace (subject to start dates and submission deadlines). Upon completion, learners receive a digital badge that can be added to their CV or portfolio to demonstrate their competency and achievement.
How are microcredentials different to degrees?
Microcredentials are a short-term, flexible, and more accessible way to develop new skills or even gain experience of a degree programme before committing to a full programme. They are focused and specialised, allowing learners to target the exact skills they need for their career goals, future plans, or personal interests. Microcredentials can be beneficial for anyone who wants to improve their professional development, change their career path, or pursue lifelong learning. They can help learners stay ahead of the changing demands of the workplace, showcase their expertise in a niche area, or explore new topics and fields of interest. Some microcredentials may be used as prior learning onto one of our degree programmes. For further information on courses which are eligible for this, please see our course pages.
How do I study a microcredential?
The study of microcredentials often takes place online. A variety of engaging educational resources, including videos and quizzes, will be used to help you gain practical skills. By exchanging thoughts and experiences with other students, you can develop your skills, self-assurance, and knowledge. A subject tutor will also assist you; their job will be to facilitate talks and provide guidance and feedback on your learning. It is recommended that you study for approximately 7-10 hours per week to complete the course. This includes independent study, self-guided research, and assignments.
Can I study more than one microcredential at a time?
Yes, you can study more than one at a time, but you need to ensure you can study for 7-10 hours per week per microcredential. Please be mindful of the study commitment and be sure you can accommodate this around other commitments.

Privately Rented Accommodation | Accommodation | University of LincolnPrivately Rented Accommodation in Lincoln
Choosing Privately Rented Accommodation
Before you arrive in the UK, it is important to ensure that you have arranged suitable accommodation and that you are able to move in prior to starting your studies. If you are intending to live in privately rented accommodation, we encourage you to research the options available as soon as possible.
Accommodation in the UK can be expensive, which is why international students must provide evidence of the financial requirement to be eligible for a Student visa.
We encourage you to carefully consider how much you can afford to spend on accommodation each month. For further information and advice on the cost of living in the UK, please visit ourLiving in the UK webpage.
To secure privately rented accommodation, students are required to sign a legally binding contract, often referred to as a tenancy agreement. It is important to remember that once you have signed a tenancy agreement, you will be liable to pay rent even if you decide to live elsewhere.
Before choosing privately rented accommodation and signing a tenancy agreement, here are some important things that you will need to consider:
Most of the available privately rented student accommodation in Lincoln is based within a flat or a house with sole occupancy bedrooms and communal living areas. If you would prefer to live alone, please remember that studio flats and one-bedroom apartments are difficult to find and significantly more expensive.
Tenancy agreements in the UK are usually valid for a fixed period of time. Once you have signed a tenancy agreement, you will be required to pay rent for the duration specified within the contract.
International students will often be required to provide a guarantor to confirm a tenancy agreement. To be eligible, a guarantor must live in the UK and sign a contract confirming that they will accept liability for rent if you are unable to pay. If you do not have a guarantor, you may be required to pay rent for the duration of the contract in advance.
In addition to rent, you might need to pay additional monthly bills for gas, electricity, water, and internet. It is important to consider these costs when planning your budget. For further information and guidance on the average you can expect to pay on bills in privately rented accommodation, please visit ourLiving in the UK webpage.
In the UK, privately rented accommodation is often unfurnished. If you are considering an unfurnished property, it is important to budget for the cost of purchasing basic furniture. You will also need to purchase essential items such as bedding and kitchen equipment.
If you decide to live away from the University, you will need to research how you will travel to campus on a regular basis and how much this will cost. This is important because your timetable may include classes that you must attend on campus up to five days each week.
Securing a Privately Rented Property
The cost and size of privately rented accommodation will vary, and to support students in exploring suitable options, we have listed a variety of property marketplaces below. You can visit these websites to search for available houses and flats to rent. We would also recommend that students use theHousing Accreditation Scheme to explore Students Union accredited properties and trusted landlords when searching for a privately rented property.
In the UK, a landlord is the owner of a privately rented property. The landlord is legally required to check your passport and visa to ensure that you, and any dependents, have the right tolive in the UK.
To secure an available property, the landlord may also ask you to make a tenancy deposit. This is a sum of money, payable in advance, which will be returned at the end of the tenancy agreement if there is no damage to the property or rent owed. Your landlord is legally required to pay your deposit into a protected and government-approved tenancy deposit scheme.
Prior to signing a tenancy agreement, please ensure that you have read the contract carefully and understand when you will be required to pay rent. It is important that you make a note of the name and contact details of the propertys landlord in case of an emergency. For further guidance on securing privately rented accommodation, please visit theUK Council for International Student Affairs information and advice page.
Finding Family Accommodation
The city of Lincoln and the surrounding area is a popular destination to live, work and study, and demand for family accommodation has increased significantly in recent years.
Unfortunately, this means that the availability of privately rented accommodation for families is very limited and you may need to explore options outside of the city.
Lincolnshire has limited public transport, and if your accommodation is outside of the city you will need to think carefully about how you will travel to University, and how much that might cost. To support students in exploring suitable options, we have listed nearby towns and cities that are within a commutable distance of Lincoln below.
Family accommodation can be expensive, and you will need to think carefully about your budget. Depending on the size and location, the costs are likely to be between 800-1,500 per month for a 2-3 bed property.
If you are planning to bring your family with you to the UK, you must ensure that you have secured accommodation before your dependents arrive in Lincoln. If you are unable to find suitable family accommodation, you should arrive independently and make arrangements for your dependants to join you once you have a secured a suitable place to live.
It is important to remember that if you plan to apply for the Graduate visa following the completion of your studies, your dependents do not have to live in the UK for the duration of your degree. Your dependants will still be eligible for the Graduate visa if they travel to the UK towards the end of your studies, prior to the end date of your Student visa.
On a Student visa your dependants may live anywhere in the UK, and can choose to live with family members elsewhere in the country. However, as a student it is important to remember that you will be required to travel to campus on a regular basis and should plan to live nearby. This is important because your timetable may include classes that you must attend on campus up to five days each week.

This may include outreach work, financial support, careers and employability guidance, academic support, and much more. We also have a summary of our Access and Participation Plan.

Contextual offers are one of the ways we remove the barriers to higher education, ensuring that we have fair access for all students regardless of background and personal experiences. To make it fairer, we consider the information you give us on your UCAS form about your personal circumstances and the impact these might have on your qualifications when we make a decision on your application.You can find out more about contextual offers on our Offer Guide pages.

When we make applicants an offer to study with us, well send them detailed information about the conditions of the offer. Below youll find more information on the types of offers we may make, and some examples of typical offers. If youre applying through UCAS, you can track the status of your application and any offers received in UCAS Hub.
Types of Offer
We have three types of offers for applications to our undergraduate courses.
Unconditional Offers
ve already got your qualifications and have met the academic requirements, depending on your course, you might still need to complete a DBS or occupational health check, provide proof of your results, or meet other specific non-academic requirements.", 'Conditional Offers
A conditional offer means that your place is subject to you meeting certain conditions, usually based on upcoming exam results. For example, if you are currently studying for A levels, International Baccalaureate, T levels, or a BTEC National Diploma, we will ask that you achieve specific grades. Some courses may have additional requirements, like an Enhanced DBS Check.
Contextual Offers
At Lincoln, we recognise that not everybody has had the same advice and support to help them get to higher education. Its important to us to have a diverse, inclusive university community with students and staff who bring a range of voices and experiences.
Contextual offers are one of the ways we remove the barriers to higher education, ensuring that we have fair access for all students regardless of background and personal experiences. To make it fairer, we consider the information you give us on your UCAS form about your personal circumstances and the impact these might have on your qualifications when we make a decision on your application. 
If you meet our general criteria for a contextual offer, the grades we will ask you to achieve to join the University will be 8 UCAS Tariff points lower than the standard entry requirements for the majority of our undergraduate degree courses. For example, if the course you apply to has standard entry requirements of 112 UCAS Tariff points, a contextual offer would ask you to achieve 104. Students eligible for a contextual offer for our MPharm Pharmacy programme will be asked to achieve 16 UCAS Tariff points lower than the standard entry requirements.
Schools who have entered into our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) partnership will be eligible for a reduction in tariff equal to that provided by our contextual offers.
You will be eligible for a contextual offer if, at the point you are making your application, you live in an area of the UK where young people have a lower rate of progression to higher education than other areas.
To determine this, we use the POLAR4 (Participation of Local Areas) data available in your UCAS application. This is a tool that measures how likely young people are to participate in higher education across the UK and shows how this varies by area, classing them into five groups, called quintiles. Quintile 1 shows the lowest rate of participation and quintile 5 the highest. If your postcode falls into quintile 1 or 2, you will be eligible for a contextual offer from Lincoln.
You can check whether your home address qualifies for a contextual offer by entering your postcode into thePOLAR checking toolof the Office for Students (OfS) website.
You dont need to do anything extraplease apply to us through UCAS and if you meet our eligibility criteria you will be automatically considered for a contextual offer.
You will need to be a Home (UK) fee paying applicant. Contextual offers only apply to full-time undergraduate programmes. Foundation programmes are excluded.
Typical Offers
Below are some examples of offers we may make. You can find detailed entry requirements for each programme on our course pages, so please check these carefully for any additional subject specific criteria.
Only Studying A Level Qualifications
For A levels, a typical offer may be A minimum of 112 UCAS Tariff points from a minimum of two A levels or equivalent. This is the same as achieving BBC in your A levels, but we also accept a variation such as ABC. If two A Levels are successfully achieved, we will also consider your results from other level three qualifications such as the EPQ.
Only Studying a BTEC Qualification
For a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma, a typical offer may be Distinction, Merit, Merit (DMM) or an equivalent grade combination." DMM equals a total of 112 UCAS Tariff points. BTEC Level 3 Diploma can be considered in lieu of two A levels against our general entry requirements and the BTEC Level 3 Subsidiary Diploma in lieu of one A level.
Studying a Mix of a Level and BTEC Qualifications
With a mix of A levels and BTEC qualifications a typical offer may be A minimum of 112 UCAS Tariff points from a minimum of two A levels or equivalent.

PGR How to Apply | Postgraduate Research | University of LincolnPostgraduate Research
How to Apply
Applying for a Research Degree
The University of Lincoln offers a range of research programmes, including MA/MSc by Research, MPhil, and PhD, and you can apply for these via the specific course pages on our website.
Before you submit your application, you will first need to identify a supervisory team or sta member that has expertise in the area you wish to research. You are then encouraged to contact them directly to discuss your proposed project and suitability. You may need to produce a research proposal (depending on the subject area), which provides an overview of the topic you intend to research. We also strongly advise you to check entry requirements for your programme before submitting your application. These can be found on the individual course pages.
You will need to do some research before applying for your chosen programme to identify potential supervisors at Lincoln whose research interests align with your own.
You can discover more about the University of Lincoln's key research strengths and latest studies on our main research pages. You can also explore the research being carried out by academic experts across our institutes, centres, and groups.
You may want to search our website for specific subject areas and topics or browse our research repository, where you will find details of academics and research studies relating to your own field. Our College and School sites also offer more information about research expertise and recent projects.
Once you have identified a potential supervisor, you should contact them via email to discuss your application. Details can be found in our staff directory. If you have an agreement in principle that a member of staff will supervise your research, you can submit your application with your research proposal.
Some PGR programmes require a research proposal as part of the application. This is a project outline identifying what you want to study, why you want to investigate this area, and how you intend to conduct the research. You are not expected to be the expert, but you will need to demonstrate a sound knowledge of the subject and where your research will make a valuable contribution to the topic.
Remember that your proposal is the starting point of your research. It is normal for your ideas to evolve and develop, and for plans to change as you engage more deeply with the literature and begin working with your supervision team.
Here are some general points for writing your research proposal. Some subjects have specific requirements, so please check the individual course pages or speak to your potential supervisor or supervisory team.
Length of Proposal
For a PhD your proposal should be 3,000 to 5,000 words (excluding references). A Masters by Research requires a proposal of between 1,000 and 2,000 words.
Structuring Your Research Proposal
There isnt a prescribed format for the structure of a research proposal but the following section headings are generally considered to be important:
Working Title
A clear and succinct description of your research should be encapsulated in the title. Although this may not be the title of your final thesis, your proposal title should give a clear indication of the area you are interested in exploring.
Introduction
The introduction should set the context, explaining what you will research, why it is of value, and how you propose to conduct your research. The introduction is your opportunity to demonstrate that your proposed research can make a significant contribution to existing bodies of literature, detailing how your research will fill a gap or develop/complete findings from previous research. Overall, you will be expected to show that you have a good knowledge of the wider context in which your research belongs and that you have awareness of methodologies, theories, and conflicting evidence in your chosen field.
Overview of Your Research
You should provide a short overview of your research and where it fits in existing academic discourses, debates, or literature. This should also cover your research objectives, why the research is needed, and what original contribution it can make. Make sure your overview is intelligible to someone who is not a specialist in this field
Literature Review
You wont have had chance to review all the relevant literature at this stage, but you should be able to incorporate the major debates and issues, demonstrating that you understand your chosen field. Show how your research is original and how it will address the gaps in current knowledge. The conclusion of the review should include a statement of your research problem or question.
Methodology
Your methodology section should detail how you will conduct your research and consider the following:
Timescales
You should provide a clear plan of how you will carry out the research from start to finish, breaking it down into the main components of the research project and identifying what you expect to do in each year of your studies.
Top Tips for a Good Research Proposal
The University accepts a range of qualications for its programmes but you should check that you meet the entry requirements for your chosen course as these vary. Please visit the course pages on our website for more information.
For prospective international students looking to apply for a University of Lincoln postgraduate research degree, it is important that you are aware of the specific requirements that you may need for your chosen course.

CAS and Student Visa
How do I apply for my CAS and my Student Visa?
How do I apply for my CAS?
New students can request a CAS up tofour months before the start date of their course, providing the visa application will be made outside of the UK. If made from inside the UK, a CAS can be requested up to three months before the course start date. Requests are usually processedwithin 15 to 20 working days, where possible, from the date the required payment is received by the University.
Please note that you must pay for your PEASS course before you apply for your CAS. If you apply for a CAS before you have paid for your course then the CAS request will be rejected. Information on how to pay via Convera is available at Payment of Fees
We strongly encourage applicants to complete the payment and CAS request process as soon as they are eligible to do so. This will help to ensure sufficient time to apply for your visa and arrive in the UK before the start of your studies. More detailed information can be found hereApplying for your CAS and Student Visa.
Complete the online CAS request form by logging into the University'sonline application system, OneUni. Use your applicant ID number and password to log in and click on the 'My Details' function in the 'Forms' tab.
If you have a question aboutvisas and immigration please emailinternationaladvice@lincoln.ac.uk

Have you used your CAS to apply for a visa?
As soon as you have your CAS, use it to apply for a Student Visa. Visa processing times vary and we recommend that you visit theUK Government websitefor guidance.
You will need to book an appointment to attend a Visa Application Centre with your documents and you may have to attend a Credibility Interview. Your biometric information will be taken, such as your fingerprints and a photograph. You will then receive a decision letter from UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) regarding the status of your visa application.

Will I get a joint CAS to cover the duration of the PEASS course AND my main programme of study?
Online PEASS- If you study PEASS online in your home country and if passing is a condition of your main course offer, you will be issued a CAS after you pass your PEASS course.
On Campus PEASS You may receive a CAS for PEASS and your main course if you have an unconditional main course offer, or if English language is the only condition of your main course offerandyoucurrently have B1 in one or more elements of your IELTS qualification. You will receive a CAS for On Campus PEASS only if you do not fulfil either criterion. You will receive support from the International Advice team to submit a visa extension application on successful completion of the PEASS course.

How long will it take to get my Student Visa?
Postal applications usually take 2-3 months to return from UKVI. This can be longer during peak times. You must submit your visa application to UKVI before your current leave to remain expires to ensure you do not become an overstayer. Your application is not affected if your leave to remain expires while UKVI are processing your application.u202f
In-person applications are decided on the day. If successful, your residency permit will be sent to you a few days after your application has been processed. You do need to pre-book an appointment; at peak times the appointments can get booked up weeks in advance.u202f
