Kamelija Abolevic
"Studying abroad can be challenging thats true, but I can honestly say it is by far the most rewarding thing I have ever done. During my studies in Tokyo at Rikkyo University, I was able to see the world in a different light and become global minded as a result. Experiencing other cultures broadens your knowledge base and teaches you to think and live differently."

I made amazing friends from all over the world and take every opportunity to go and visit them or to return to Bergen. It truly became my home from home and was by far the best year of my life."", '"Japan is a very amazing place full exciting new things that you would not find in Europe. It feels like a completely different world with a lot of many delicious food. This experience has taught me so many things about life."

Reece Townsend
"The time I spent living and studying, at Universitt Augsburg, in Germany proved to be invaluable and I would certainly recommend the experience to others keen to explore life abroad. It was very interesting to learn about the law from a different jurisdiction. I also participated in German language and culture classes at the University, which catered for all abilities."

What You Need to Know
This page provides a breakdown of essential information to consider when planning a period studying, working, or volunteering abroad.
All students will be invited to attend a pre-departure conference delivered by the Global Opportunities Team to help them prepare for a study abroad or overseas trip. This conference session aims to ensure students are prepared for all aspects of their travel, from the application stage, planning their accommodation and travel booking, applying for the necessary visas, making module selections, and applications for funding scholarships, right through to their return home.
It can be a lengthy process and requires organisation and dedication on the part of the student, but its little to ask for such a great opportunity, and the majority of students who return to Lincoln each year all say what a fantastic time they have had, with many saying its been the best year of their life!
Why Go Global?
s future. The programmes provide the opportunity to experience different cultures and lifestyles and increase independence and adaptability.", 'According to Universities UK International in 2019, students who study abroad are more likely to get a first in their degree, are less likely to be unemployed, and more likely to be in a graduate job than their non-mobile peers. They are also likely to earn on average seven per cent more than the average earnings six months after graduating.
Furthermore, many of our Study Abroad alumni have commented that it was their Study Abroad experience which led them to either further study at postgraduate level, or further travel or even work overseas after graduation.
"My study year abroad at Appalachian State University was one of the best years of my life, so I 100 per cent recommend anyone who has the opportunity to go for it."

How to Apply
The application process typically spans 12 weeks. It includes a written application and often an interview. Upon registering your interest, you will be sent an application form either by your Schools exchanges coordinator for semester and year abroad programmes, or by Global Opportunities for shorter trips in which you will be asked to complete a 500-word motivation statement and fill in some brief demographical data.
Applications for shorter overseas trips are submitted securely via Microsoft Forms and assistance is available on request. If you are successful at the application stage, you may be invited to an interview where you will be asked a series of standardised questions. For semester/year study abroad programmes, the School exchanges coordinator will confirm their application process as it may vary from School to School but will follow a similar pattern to the one explained here.
If you are organising your own trip or undertaking an overseas activity with a third-party provider, please email GO@lincoln.ac.uk to be sent any relevant funding application forms.
Visa Guidance
Visa guidance differs depending on your nationality and the country you are travelling to, but in most cases, students undertaking either study or work placements in most countries, including within the EU, will require a study or work visa for periods over 90 days. The pre-departure conference delivered by the Global Opportunities team will cover information relating to your visa in more detail and signpost students to specific destination related support.
Before beginning the process of obtaining a visa, we encourage students to consider:
If you cant find the answers you are looking for on the relevant embassy website, our dedicated Visa Advice Team (based within the Student Support Centre) can offer you guidance and tips on things such as documentation, evidence, and help with the application process. You can contact them at advice@lincoln.ac.uk.
Student Support
Global Opportunities Team provides a pre-departure conference for all students undertaking an overseas mobility. During this we highlight what support is available to the student and provide guidance on how to access services such as Student Minds, as well as the Student Support Centre, Student Wellbeing, University Health Centre, and Careers and Employability Team upon your return.
During the pre-departure conference, students are also guided on how to fill out the risk assessment, and are made aware of any pre-departure skills groups which are available. We encourage you to learn a small amount of the language of your host destination to lessen potential 'culture shock' or anxiety. There are a number of student led free introductory language and culture informal classes offered each year by native speakers which introduce the language and culture of the chosen country through weekly sessions. For more information contact Cultural Exchange Sessions (CES) at ces@lincoln.ac.uk.
For more formal language classes, the University of Lincoln offers a variety of language modules, each carrying 30 credits. Unless a language module is available as part of a specific degree programme, there is a charge for the classes, which can be reimbursed via the Universitys Turing programme upon successful completion of both the language module and the exchange programme. Further details can be found at https://www.lincoln.ac.uk/lbs/languageshortcourses/.
Whilst Covid-19 travel regulations have been either reduced or removed all together, with each country likely to have different requirements or restrictions, we still recommend checking the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Offices (FCDO)travel advice website for up-to-date information and any other safety and security alerts. The FCDO website will also outline any entry requirements that apply to any country and these must be assessed carefully when planning a trip or preparing for departure.
Funding Information
Living abroad requires budgeting for things such as visas, travel, insurance, accommodation, and general living costs. There are a range of funding opportunities available to support students through their overseas experience, regardless of financial background. Whether students are intending to study abroad, work, or undertake a short-term overseas trip, many may be eligible to receive a grant and/or scholarship to assist with these costs. The amount awarded will depend on the destination and duration of each individual overseas experience.
Examples of funding available include:
The Turing Scheme
This is UK Government funding scheme to facilitate study abroad, overseas work placements, or other short-term opportunities between 4 weeks up to 12 months. Funding typically ranges from 335 - 545 per month depending on duration and destination. Additional funding for direct travel costs is available for students from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Course Related Travelling Grant
You can apply for up to 500 via an online application form available upon request by emailing studentrevenue@lincoln.ac.uk.
To make opportunities more accessible, the University is able to provide additional funds to support students who are from a low-income household, are first in family to go to university, are from an ethnic minority, are a care leaver, have caring responsibilities at home, or have declared a disability to the University, via funding programmes such as Turing, who each year provides additional funding for students for Study abroad programmes.
In addition, the University of Lincoln offers its own Course Related Travel Grant to students who need additional financial support to support their travel related expenses for overseas opportunities linked to their degree programme.
