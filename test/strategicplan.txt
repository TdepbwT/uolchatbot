Management and Strategy | About the University | University of LincolnTransforming Lives and Communities
Strategic Plan 2022-27
The University of Lincoln is a university of and for the 21st Century. Dynamic, enterprising, and globally connected. We nurture talent and ideas, contribute globally by creating and sharing knowledge, and demonstrably help to transform lives and communities for the better.
We were established in 1996, in one building on a brownfield site. Charged with enriching the citys economic, social, and cultural life, we were named the University of Lincoln in 2001. Since then, we have grown into a flourishing anchor institution that contributes over 400m to the local economy. Throughout this exciting period of development, we have been guided by a consistent set of principles: excellence in teaching, learning, and quality of student experience; responsiveness to the needs of communities and organisations; and working in partnership to make great things happen.
This strategic plan, covering the period to 2027, marks a major point in our history as we focus on realising our long-term ambition of being seen as a university that contributes significantly to the nations success through regional regeneration and international connectivity.

Since then, we have grown into a flourishing anchor institution that contributes over 400m to the local economy. Throughout this exciting period of development, we have been guided by a consistent set of principles: excellence in teaching, learning, and quality of student experience; responsiveness to the needs of communities and organisations; and working in partnership to make great things happen.
Because we were created on an empty site, we have been able to build facilities, degree programmes, and teaching and learning environments that prime students for success in a challenging world both now and in the future.
Because we care about the needs of communities, we conduct regionally relevant and globally impactful research: driving productivity and reducing carbon impact in food and farming industries; ensuring that people in rural and coastal communities can live long and healthy lives; and conserving, curating, and sharing our cultural heritage.
This strategic plan, covering the period to 2027, marks a major point in our history as we focus on realising our long-term ambition of being seen as a university that contributes significantly to the nations success through regional regeneration and international connectivity.
Achieving this vision will require us to look outwards, attracting talent and ideas from around the world, to improve communities beyond, as well as within, our city and region. We must deliver the most appropriate educational courses, provide the best student experience, and conduct the most relevant research. Our academic structures, support services, physical and digital infrastructure, and processes must be fit for purpose.
By 2027, we expect to have a larger and more international student body with a higher proportion of postgraduate taught students; a greater diversity of programme types and delivery mechanisms; a larger research order book with more staff conducting internationally recognised research; more and stronger partnerships with external organisations; greater income from consultancy and licensing; and a higher proportion of international staff. At the same time, we must maintain our reputation for civic engagement, and for a committed staff community that delivers a supportive and stimulating student experience.
This will be no easy task. The external environment is uncertain and change is incessant. We must be agile and sharply focused, innovative and responsive, bold and ambitious. Displaying entrepreneurial flair, a collaborative spirit, and a fearless attitude, we must build on and transcend our historical achievements, to create a thriving future for Lincoln, Greater Lincolnshire, and beyond.

We will strive for excellence recognising and working on our areas for improvement whilst celebrating individual success and achievement.
Our inspirational teaching staff, gifted researchers, expert professional service staff, and engaged student body have a distinctive way of working together, which we refer to as One Community. This is a collective mindset, through which we promote equality, listen to each other, understand different points of view, are kind to each other, and accept each other for who we are.
Alongside this, we have a set of guiding principles that outline how we can best operate to improve the lives of students, staff, and the communities and region we serve.

How We Transform 
Implementation
If our purpose is to transform lives, then we must start by transforming ourselves. We must have clarity of purpose in everything we do, from how we deliver our teaching and learning, to the focus and conduct of our research, and the nature of our university structures. This must be done with quality, efficiently delivered, and focused on delivering our vision and ambition.
Measure of Success
We enter into this next stage of our development during a period of considerable uncertainty for both the sector and the wider world. We will rise to the challenges this poses.
By 2027, we expect to have increased and diversified our student numbers within a wider range of flexible delivery mechanisms. We will have a greater focus on research, with more staff conducting internationally recognised research, and we will have increased and diversified our income from sources such as research, consultancy, and licensing. At the same time, we will have maintained our reputation for teaching excellence and delivering a supportive and stimulating student experience. We will have developed people, processes, and structures so that they perform at the highest possible levels, ensuring efficiency and effectiveness in everything we do.
We will measure our progress towards the achievement of our 2027 ambition through clearly identified key performance indicators that ably measure the step change we wish to achieve through the next five years of this plan and beyond.

Regional Engagement | Management and Strategy | University of LincolnStrategic Plan
Civic and Regional Engagement
Our CivicResponsibilities
The regional strategy objective is to ensure the University meets its civic responsibilities and commitment to making a real difference to peoples lives, increasing opportunities, and supporting the regions prosperity agenda. The strategy aims to align as appropriate:
We aim to align with:
Regional development priorities.  
We aim to align with:
Government policy priorities (e.g. Levelling Up and Towns Fund) and national grand challenges (e.g. clean growth, decarbonisation, and net zero).  
We aim to align with:
University research and knowledge exchange (RKE) and industry engagement priorities.  
We aim to align with:
University education and development provision and those areas and fields in which the University is already heavily engaged with industry and local authorities (e.g. engineering, energy, defence and security, agri-tech, food processing, health and wellbeing). Together these activities can deliver new and inclusive opportunities for the region.
Being for and of Greater Lincolnshire gives the Universitys approach its distinctive character. Our strengths have grown round the assets of the region. We have developed a range of initiatives and research expertise based on the need to address significant inequalities across the geography.
Key to the success of the strategy are coherence, focus, and the principle of reinforcing success in order to maximise the synergy of the Universitys efforts across a broad spectrum of activity. It is also important to continue to horizon scan and remain agile as external priorities and policies evolve or change.
Regional Priorities
Sectors in which the region has a competitive advantage and offer real growth opportunities include agri-food, manufacturing, energy, health and care, ports and logistics, defence and security, and visitor economy.
From these sectors, the Greater Lincolnshire Local Enterprise Partnership (GLLEP) has identified four key sectors which present game-changing, high-potential opportunities for growth, investment, and collaboration on a region-wide scale: the Humber Freeport (transforming the Humber ports into one of the most smart, clean, and efficient port clusters in the world), UK Food Valley (championing automation and resource efficiency and reducing the UKs reliance on food imports), Green Energy (home to the worlds largest wind farm the region will capitalise on its clean growth assets by acting as a test-bed for technologies in clean energy, storage, and distribution), and Defence and Security (creating a cluster of innovation-focused defence and security companies to ensure Greater Lincolnshire is the first choice location for defence-related industries). 
The Freeport runs along the Humber encompassing N and NE Lincs, including Scunthorpe and Grimsby; the Food Valley north to south from Grimsby (fish and protein) through Holbeach (National Centre for Food Manufacturing (NCFM)) to Boston; Green Energy focused along the Humber and east coast; and Defence and Security clustered around Lincoln and the RAF bases across Greater Lincolnshire.
Supporting the growth of the burgeoning creative industries sector, the University is supporting a wide range of initiatives across the region, which build capacity and drive the skills agenda through economic inclusion activity and business support (e.g. Barbican Creative Hub and Grimsby Creates).
Alongside these regional advantages, partners have identified some of the barriers constraining opportunity. The Universitys Regional Inequality Commission has identified the following factors as contributing to inequality: health and wellbeing; community, belonging, and recovery; education, skills, and the labour market; innovation, investment, and ambition; place, culture, and connectivity. The University already undertakes significant activities to address issues in these areas of concern; the regional strategy will draw these activities together to increase connections across the University and beyond, so its work has maximum effect.
Government Policy Priorities
The Governments Levelling Up Agenda and Greater Lincolnshire Town Fund deals focus on Lincoln, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Connected Coast (Mablethorpe and Skegness), and Boston.
On the Lincolnshire border, Newark also secured a Town Fund deal. The University is a member of all these Town Fund Boards, which are seeking to address deprivation, lack of opportunity and low aspiration, and access to high skill, high value, better paid jobs.
Two of the first four Government Grand Challenges, Artificial Intelligence and Data (including a specific mission to improve health outcomes) and Clean Growth, align with the regions key sectors and game changers and the Universitys RKE Strategy (i.e. manufacturing and clean growth, green energy, health and social care, and defence and security).
Paralleling the increasing emphasis on energy independence is that of food independence and supply chain resilience, which align with the regions development of the Food Valley, Freeport and logistics, and the Universitys focus on agri-tech, net zero, and defence and security.
Key to success will be the Universitys ability to work with regional partners to build long-term plans and programmes knitting together a fragmented funding and policy environment to achieve long-term effect. For example, within the Creative and Heritage sectors, the University is providing strategic and delivery support across several Towns Fund programmes, enhancing coherence, and leveraging funds.
University Research and Knowledge Exchange
The Universitys Research and Knowledge Exchange Strategy identifies agri-food technology, defence, net zero, and rural health as priority clusters for its industrial research.
These areas align with the regions development priorities (UK Food Valley, green energy, defence and security), Government levelling up, and grand challenge initiatives (e.g. addressing deprivation and poor health outcomes through Town Fund investment and use of AI and data, clean growth, and the Freeport), and the Universitys education development and interventions(e.g. Academy Trust, LIoT, and NCFM).
The Universitys Industrial Engagement Strategy supports its civic and regional engagement ensuring research and teaching is relevant and effective.
The Lincolnshire Science and Innovation Park (LSIP) adjacent to the Universitys Lincoln campus has and is attracting businesses keen to access the Universitys academics, research and innovation facilities, and professional development capability. Many of these companies align with the Universitys research priority clusters outlined above.
In addition, the Universitys policy engagement capability has identified core opportunities to increase linkages between research findings and the development of policy interventions to achieve effect at the regional level.
UniversityEducation Provision
Beyond its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, many of which were developed in conjunction with local and national employers (e.g. engineering and Siemens), the University has sought to reach out across the region to support the efforts of others and fill gaps.
This work encompasses traditional education and multiple forms of learn while you earn provision working with companies and other organisational bodies.
The University led the bid to establish a Lincolnshire Institute of Technology (LIoT) working in partnership with Bakkavor and OAL Ltd and seven FE colleges: DN Colleges Group (Scunthorpe), The TEC Partnership (Grimsby), Lincoln College, Lincoln University Technical College, Bishop Burton College, Boston College, and Grantham College.
s priority themes of business growth and skills development in agri-food, food manufacturing, energy, digital, and engineering sharing the common theme of Industry 4.0.", 'The Universitys NCFM is based in Holbeach at the centre of the regions food processing industry and is collocated with the University Academy Holbeach providing education and strong employment pathways into the agri-food industry. NCFMs LIoT facility and the Universitys Centre of Excellence for Food Industry Innovation are located on the South Lincolnshire Food Enterprise Zone. 
The Universitys work to increase access and participation is a core activity to support the future regional economy in an area where progression rates from school to HE are very low and recruitment to graduate level employment a challenge. Our whole-institution approach is centred on seeking local solutions, as referenced in the Access and Participation Plan. Supporting strong graduate outcomes is a key element of improving social mobility and is underpinned by working with regional employers to increase demand for high-level skills.
Civic mission is at the heart of the University of Lincoln. We are here for the long term, working with regional partners towards a shared endeavour of regional health, wealth, and opportunity.
University of Lincoln Strategic Plan 2022-27

Coherence, Focus, and Reinforcing Success
There is a high level of coherence between the four areas (regional priorities, government priorities, university research and knowledge exchange, and university education provision) set out above in terms of subject matter and location. Four of the six Greater Lincolnshire Towns Fund locations have a LIoT facility (Lincoln, Scunthorpe, Grimsby, and Boston).
The Government focus on the Humber and NE Lincolnshire coast for green energy, clean growth (includes decarbonisation and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS)) and net zero development encompasses Scunthorpe, Grimsby, and Mablethorpe and aligns with the Universitys RKE and education engagement. The Humber Freeport also encompasses Scunthorpe, Grimsby, Clean Growth, Town Fund, and LIoT.
The UK Food Valley development aligns with the Universitys RKE and education provision (in Lincoln, Holbeach  LIoT and University Academy Trust  and Grimsby). The RKE defence and security focus aligns with a regional game changer, the Governments Defence and Security Industrial and Net Zero Strategies, AI and Data Grand Challenge and LSIP development. The challenges of rural health and social care outcomes align with RKE, Levelling Up, and a regional growth sector.
This alignment of government, regional, and university focus brings coherence to the effort and resource the University can bring to bear to make a regional difference. Reinforcing University success in education, levelling up, agri-food technology, defence and security, creative sector, net zero, and rural health in the key locations of Lincoln, Humber South Bank, Connected Coast, and Boston/Holbeach will deliver maximum regional impact.
The University will seek better to understand where it can draw together its assets to have a positive effect on regional inequality over the long term. This means, alongside the focus on building regional opportunity through key sectors and clusters, we will also focus on social impact. We will combine our community engagement resources and capability and work with a significant breadth of third sector organisations with whom we collaborate to support opportunities, which will benefit individuals as well as sectors and organisations.
