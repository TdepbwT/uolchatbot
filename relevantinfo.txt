RESEARCH IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF FILM, MEDIA AND JOURNALISM
QUESTIONS OF REPRESENTATION, ETHICS, CREDIBILITY, AND PERSPECTIVE UNDOUBTEDLY PERVADE THE 21ST-CENTURY MEDIA LANDSCAPE. FROM TV STREAMING PRACTICES TO GLOBAL CINEMAS, FROM AUTHORITY TO AUTHORSHIP, MASS MEDIA TO CONVERGENCE, EMERGENCE TO ECOLOGY, THE MEDIA INFILTRATE, UNDERPIN, AND INFORM EVERY ASPECT OF SOCIETY. IN SUCH A COMPLEX AND CHANGING CLIMATE, IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT OUR CAPACITY TO STUDY, ANALYSE AND CRITIQUE BOTH THE MEDIA THEMSELVES AND THE INDUSTRIES TO WHICH THEY BELONG IS A FUNDAMENTAL NEED. EQUALLY, OUR ABILITY TO RESEARCH AND STUDY MEDIA AND CULTURE RANKS AMONG THE MOST ESSENTIAL SKILLS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND OUR WORLD.

THE CENTENARY OF 1914-18, AS WELL AS THECOMMEMORATION OF THE 70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE END OF WORLD WAR 2, GAVE THESE EPIC EVENTS A HIGH PUBLIC PROFILE WORLDWIDE. THIS TIMELY PROJECT ASKED THE QUESTION: WHAT IS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE COMIC FORM TO THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THESE GLOBAL EXPERIENCES AND WHAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF HISTORICAL MEANING EMERGE?
THE PROJECT RESEARCH AND THE TWO MAJOR EXHIBITIONS THAT ACCOMPANIED IT  ONE ON WORLD WAR ONE COMICS IN 2014 AND ONE ON SECOND WORLD WAR COMICS IN 2015, BOTH AT LONDONS CARTOON MUSEUM- EMPHASISED TO THE HERITAGE INDUSTRY THE POTENTIAL OF COMICS AS A CULTURAL ARTEFACT.
CREATING A SAFE SPACE FOR JOURNALISTS TO SPEAK ABOUT TRAUMA: EXAMINING THE ROLES OF JOURNALISM EDUCATORS
THIS STUDY, SUPPORTED BY A BRITISH ACADEMY/LEVERHULME SMALL RESEARCH GRANT, CONTRIBUTES TO LITERATURE ON JOURNALISM AND TRAUMA WHICH ESTABLISHED THAT JOURNALISTS LACK SAFE SPACES TO SPEAK ABOUT TRAUMA. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT THE PREVALENCE OF PTSD AMONG JOURNALISTS IS HIGHER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND THAT THEY ARE ENGAGING IN AVOIDANCE RESPONSES (NUMBING OUT, AVOIDING REMINDERS OF THE EVENT, DIMINISHED INTERESTS) AS COPING STRATEGIES. WE ARGUE THAT JOURNALISM EDUCATORS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY IN CREATING SAFE SPACES TO TALK ABOUT TRAUMA, BUT THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH EXPLORING THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF TRAUMA AND ITS EFFECTS ON PRACTISING JOURNALISTS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO BRIDGE THIS GAP BY CONDUCTING IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH JOURNALISM EDUCATORS ABOUT THEIR AWARENESS OF TRAUMA AND ITS EFFECTS, AND FOCUS GROUPS BETWEEN JOURNALISM EDUCATORS AND MAINSTREAM/DIASPORA JOURNALISTS TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING RESILIENCE TO TRAUMA AMONG JOURNALISTS AND JOURNALISM STUDENTS, WHICH COULD ASSIST JOURNALISM SCHOOLS TO OFFER RESILIENCE TRAINING IN THEIR COURSES.
FEMINISING INFLUENCES ON MASS CIRCULATION: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LE PETIT JOURNAL AND THE DAILY MAIL
A COMPARATIVE STUDYOF LE PETIT JOURNAL AND THE DAILY MAIL
THE CONCERNS OF THIS PROJECT DEMONSTRATE THE CONTINUING DILEMMAS OF HOW FEMALE IDENTITY IS TO BE REPRESENTED BY THE MEDIA AND THE REPERCUSSIONS FOR CITIZENSHIP AND THE PUBLIC SPHERE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT FEMALE INFLUENCE ON THE EARLY MASS CIRCULATION PRESS HAS BEEN QUANTIFIED IN DETAIL, AND ALSO THE FIRST TIME THAT COMPARISONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE THEME BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES. THE RESEARCH INTO EUROPES FIRST MASS CIRCULATION DAILY AND INTO BRITAINS FIRST TABLOID DAILY REVEALS THAT CRITICISMS OF TABLOIDISATION HAVE A HISTORICAL AS WELL AS A CONTEMPORARY DIMENSION. THIS DATES BACK TO THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF THE TABLOID; IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS NOT A PURELY 20TH CENTURY PHENOMENON. PRESS HISTORIANS HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE OBVIOUS WIDENING OF AUDIENCE APPEAL IN THE MASS CIRCULATION POPULAR PRESS, REFERRED TO AS NEW JOURNALISM WITH ITS FRESH EMPHASIS ON TRIVIA, CRIME COVERAGE AND PULP SERIALISED FICTION, ALSO IMPLIED A PROGRESSIVE VIEW OF WOMEN. OUR FINDINGS PROVE OTHERWISE, REFUTING THE FEMINISATION ARGUMENT. DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FEMALE AUDIENCE WAS INTERESTED IN WERE MADE LARGELY BY MEN AND DEFINED FAIRLY CONSERVATIVELY.
DR SANEM AHIN WAS AWARDED A BA/LEVERHULME SMALL RESEARCH GRANT (2018-19) FOR HER PROJECT, JOURNALISM IN CONFLICT SOCIETIES: PROFESSIONAL ROLES, INFLUENCES AND CHALLENGES. IT EXAMINED JOURNALISTS ROLE PERCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES IN CYPRUS TO UNDERSTAND HOW JOURNALISTS NEGOTIATE THE TENSIONS BETWEEN PROFESSIONALISM AND A SENSE OF COMMUNAL BELONGING IN CONFLICT-AFFECTED SOCIETIES. INTERVIEWING JOURNALISTS AND EDITORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE DIVIDED ISLAND, THE PROJECT STUDIED HOW THEY PERCEIVED THEIR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES CONCERNING THE CONFLICT.
THIS EXHIBITION PRESENTED TWO EPISODES IN 20THCENTURY INDIAN HISTORY WHEN NEWSPAPERS EXPRESSED THE EMERGING CITIZENSHIP OF PROTEST BY THE FREEDOM MOVEMENT IN INDIA. PRESS ARTICLES AND LEAFLETS  SOMETIMES READ OUT LOUD TO A GROUP OF PEOPLE THEN DESTROYED BECAUSE OF CENSORSHIP, SOMETIMES CONSUMED INDIVIDUALLY- ACTED AS THE MAIN VEHICLE FOR THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATION OF IDEAS. SOME JOURNALS WERE USED AS TEMPORARY ACTS OF DEFIANCE TO MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR CHANGE. NATIONALIST LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS ALSO AIMED FOR COVERAGE OF PROTEST IN THE EXISTING COLONIAL NEWSPAPERS IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE CLIMATE OF OPINION IN SUPPORT FOR CHANGE. A VARIETY OF NEWSPAPERS, DESPITE SOMETIMES ONLY HAVING SMALL CIRCULATIONS, STILL BECAME PART OF THE CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LANDSCAPE THAT THEY WERE REPORTING ON.
THIS EXHIBITION FOCUSED ON TWO LITTLE KNOWN ASPECTS OF PRESS AND PROTEST  ONE IN ALLAHABAD, UNITED PROVINCES (UTTAR PRADESH) IN BRITISH INDIA, ONE IN THE FRENCH TERRITORY OF PONDICHERRY (TAMIL NADU).
THE STUDY OF DIFFERENT MODELS OF JOURNALISM HAS LED THE CENTRE, IN PARTICULAR, TO IDENTIFY PEACE JOURNALISM AS A SIGNIFICANT AREA OF RESEARCH. (SEE RICHARD KEEBLE, JOHN TULLOCH, FLORIAN ZOLLMANN EDS (2010)PEACEJOURNALISM, WAR AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION, NEW YORK: PETER LANG).

THE EDUCATION RANGES FROM LEVEL 3 TO LEVEL 6, WHETHER THAT IS VITAL INFORMATION BEING PASSED ON TO NEW ENTRY OFFICERS UNDERGOING PHASE 1 INITIAL NAVAL TRAINING (INT), MORE IN-DEPTH PHASE 2 PROFESSIONAL TRAINING LEADING TO DEGREE, OR WIDER PHASE 3 DEVELOPMENT TRAINING SUCH AS THE NAVAL ANALYSIS COURSE UNDERTAKEN BEFORE ATTENDING THE STAFF COLLEGE. THE CENTRE ALSO DELIVERS A DEDICATED DEGREE PROGRAMME TO OFFICERS FROM THE SAUDI ARABIAN NAVY AND COASTGUARD.
THE FORMAL DEGREE PROGRAMMES THE CENTRE DELIVERS ARE AS FOLLOWS:
THE SELBORNE SCHEME: A REVOLUTION IN NAVAL EDUCATION*
ADMIRAL SIR JOHN ARBUTHNOT FISHER IS MOST COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH OVERSEEING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DREADNOUGHT BATTLESHIP. REGARDED AS PERHAPS THE ULTIMATE WARSHIP OF ITS TIME THE DREADNOUGHT SEEMED TO LAUNCH A NEW ERA IN BATTLESHIP DESIGN, WHICH ANYONE WHO ASPIRED TO COMMAND THE SEA WOULD HAVE TO EMULATE AND REFINE. HOWEVER, WHEN WAR DID BREAK OUT BETWEEN BRITAIN AND GERMANY IN 1914 THE TWO GREAT FLEETS WERE MORE INCLINED TO AVOID DIRECT CONFRONTATION OF THESE LEVIATHANS, REGARDED AS FAR TOO VALUABLE AN ASSET TO RISK IN THE FACE OF ENEMY FIRE. BY THE END OF THE CONFLICT THE AGE OF THE BATTLESHIP ITSELF WAS ON THE VERGE OF ECLIPSE. COME THE SECOND WORLD WAR THE BATTLESHIP SOON FOUND ITSELF OUTCLASSED, ALMOST DEFENCELESS AGAINST THE NEW FORMS OF NAVAL WARFARE THAT HAD DEVELOPED SINCE THE LAST GLOBAL CONFLICT BOTH BENEATH AND ABOVE THE SEAS SURFACE; IT WAS THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER THAT WAS TO EMERGE FROM THE WAR AS THE CAPITAL SHIP OF A FLEET
IF THE DREADNOUGHT HERALDED THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE BATTLESHIP THEN FISHERS OTHER GREAT LEGACY TO THE ROYAL NAVY IS STILL A MOST TANGIBLE PART OF THE MODERN SERVICE. THE SELBORNE SCHEME OF NAVAL EDUCATION WAS BUT ONE COMPONENT OF THE REFORMS HE WAS TO INSTITUTE DURING HIS TIME AS SECOND SEA LORD, ALTHOUGH IT IS AFTER THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY, LORD SELBORNE, THAT THE SCHEME IS GENERALLY KNOWN. TO DESCRIBE IT AS A REVOLUTION IS NOT MERE HYPERBOLE. IT OFFERED BOYS DESTINED TO BECOME NAVAL OFFICERS A VERY MODERN EDUCATION, IN PARTICULAR THROUGH ITS INCLUSION OF THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ENGINEERING. WITH SOME MODIFICATION, IT WAS TO FORM THE BASIS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION AT DARTMOUTH FOR OVER FORTY YEARS  AN UNPRECEDENTED PERIOD OF CONTINUITY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE. INEVITABLY FISHER AND SELBORNES PLANS MET WITH OPPOSITION WHEN FIRST PUBLISHED, ON CHRISTMAS DAY 1902, PARTICULARLY FROM OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE OFFICERS, ACTIVE AND RETIRED, WHOSE PRINCIPAL OBJECTION FOCUSED ON THE INTRODUCTION OF ENGINEERING INSTRUCTION FOR EXECUTIVE AS WELL AS ENGINEERING OFFICERS AND THE APPARENT INTERCHANGEABILITY BETWEEN THE TWO BRANCHES. INDEED, SOME OF THE ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES OF THE SCHEME, SUCH AS THE FULL INCLUSION OF ROYAL MARINE AND ENGINEERING OFFICERS INTO A COMMON ENTRY AND TRAINING, FAILED TO MATERIALISE FULLY. NEVERTHELESS, THE SELBORNE-FISHER SCHEME SUCCEEDED IN ESTABLISHING DARTMOUTH AS A RESPECTABLE AND UNIQUE FORM OF PUBLIC SCHOOL, WHICH WAS TO SURVIVE IN AMENDED FORM THROUGH THE UPHEAVALS OF TWO WORLD WARS, UNTIL FINALLY SUCCUMBING TO THE DEMANDS OF SOCIAL EQUALITY WHEN THE THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD ENTRY WAS ABOLISHED BY THE POST-WAR LABOUR GOVERNMENT IN 1948.
AT THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY THE SOUNDNESS AND EFFICIENCY OF THE ROYAL NAVY WAS OF GRAVE CONCERN. SINCE THE BATTLE OF TRAFALGAR IT HAD ENJOYED ALMOST UNCHALLENGED COMMAND OF THE SEA, AND INDEED REMAINED AN IMPRESSIVE LOOKING FORCE. SUCH SUPERIORITY HAD HOWEVER BRED COMPLACENCY. WHILE OTHER NEWER NAVIES HAD BEEN QUICK TO ASSIMILATE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THE ROYAL NAVY REMAINED PSYCHOLOGICALLY ATTACHED TO A WORLD IN WHICH SAILS AND MASTS, RATHER THAN STEAM AND ENGINES, WERE THE LIFE FORCE OF A NAVY. THE SYSTEM ONBOARD HMS BRITANNIA REFLECTED THIS ILLUSION WITH ITS EMPHASIS ON TRADITIONAL SEAMANSHIP. THE INTRODUCTION OF STEAM PROPULSION IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY HAD LED TO THE RISE OF A NEW BREED OF NAVAL OFFICER; THE ENGINEER. HOWEVER, COMING GENERALLY FROM A LOWER SOCIAL CLASS, AND ENGAGED IN A TECHNICAL AND OFTEN DIRTY OCCUPATION THE ENGINEER WAS DENIED THE SAME STATUS AND OPPORTUNITIES AS THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WHO HAD RECEIVED HIS EDUCATION ON BOARD BRITANNIA. AS A RESULT A SHARP CLASS DIVIDE WAS DISTINGUISHABLE THROUGH THE OFFICER CORPS, WHILE FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF EXECUTIVE OR DECK OFFICERS, THE WORKINGS OF THE ENGINE ROOM REMAINED A MYSTERY. TO RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS A NEW SYSTEM OF ENTRY AND EDUCATION WOULD BE NECESSARY IN WHICH ALL OFFICERS WOULD RECEIVE INSTRUCTION IN ENGINEERING ALLOWING THOSE FROM ALL SOCIAL BACKGROUNDS TO BECOME SPECIALIST ENGINEERS. SIMILARLY, ROYAL MARINE OFFICERS WERE FOUND TO BE LARGELY IDLE WHEN EMBARKED ON SHIPS, LACKING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORKINGS OF THE SHIP ITSELF, WHICH WAS A WASTE OF VALUABLE HUMAN RESOURCES. IN ADDITION AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, A SYSTEM HAD TO BE DEVISED WHICH WOULD PROVIDE A WIDER POOL OF YOUNG OFFICERS FOR THE GROWING NUMBER OF RN SHIPS, PARTICULARLY THE SMALLER MORE MODERN VESSELS SUCH AS TORPEDO BOATS AND SUBMARINES.
THE INSTITUTION OF SUCH A SCHEME WOULD INEVITABLY REQUIRE AN INDIVIDUAL OF TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND VISION; THIS MAN WAS TO BE ADMIRAL SIR JOHN FISHER, WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE DURING HIS CAREER IN THE ADMIRALTY FOR A SERIES OF MAJOR REFORMS, INCLUDING THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ALL-BIG-GUN BATTLESHIP AND THE REGROUPING OF FLEETS ON A MODERN STRATEGIC BASIS. BEFORE HIS APPOINTMENT AS SECOND SEA LORD, FISHER HAD BEEN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE MEDITERRANEAN. IT WAS IN THIS POST THAT HE WAS TO OBSERVE MANY OF THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE SERVICE, WHICH HE WAS TO ATTEMPT TO REMEDY LATER IN HIS CAREER.
SUBSEQUENTLY SELBORNE INVITED FISHER TO TAKE UP THE POSITION OF SECOND SEA LORD, THE MEMBER OF THE ADMIRALTY BOARD WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERSONNEL. SUCH WAS FISHERS CONCERN FOR NAVAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION THAT HE WAS WILLING TO TAKE UP THE POST, WHICH WOULD NORMALLY HAVE BEEN HELD BY A REAR ADMIRAL, WHEREAS FISHER WAS A FULL ADMIRAL. ON FEBRUARY 25TH 1902, BEFORE LEAVING HIS POST IN THE MEDITERRANEAN, FISHER OUTLINED HIS IDEAS IN A PAPER:
THE GENERAL GOOD AND EFFICIENCY OF THE NAVY RENDERS IT IMPERATIVE THAT THE ENTRY OF ENGINEER STUDENTS AT PRESENT ARRANGED SHOULD BE GRADUALLY STOPPED AND THE ENTRY OF NAVAL CADETS GRADUALLY INCREASED IN LIKE PROPORTION, AND THAT INSTRUCTION FROM THE MOMENT OF ENTRY INTO THE COLLEGE AT DARTMOUTH SHOULD IN LARGE MEASURE, AT LEAST HALF THE TIME, DEVOTED TO ENGINEERING. THAT LIKE GUNNERY, TORPEDO AND NAVIGATING AS AT PRESENT, THERE SHOULD BE ENGINEER OFFICERS, SUB-LIEUTENANTS, LIEUTENANTS AND COMMANDERS, AND GOING ON PERHAPS TO THE CAPTAINS LIST AND THE FLAG LIST, BUT THE PAY IN VIEW OF GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES (THE EXTRA PAY, THAT IS) SHOULD BE SUCH AS WOULD PERHAPS INDUCE OFFICERS TO PREFER REMAINING IN THE ENGINEER CLASS.1   
FISHERS IDEAS WERE BY NO MEANS ORIGINAL. THE DEFENCE WRITER AND FORMER ROYAL MARINE SIR JOHN COLOMB, FOR EXAMPLE, HAD BEEN ADVOCATING THE IDEA OF A COMMON ENTRY FOR TWENTY YEARS, AND SOME ASPECTS OF THE PROPOSED INSTRUCTION AT DARTMOUTH HAD BEEN ELABORATED IN AN ARTICLE IN NATIONAL REVIEW, IN JUNE 1900, BY REAR ADMIRAL C. C. PENROSE FITZGERALD. FISHER ALSO SOUGHT INSPIRATION AND ADVICE FROM SUCH AUTHORITIES AS SIR JULIAN CORBETT AND CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER CRADOCK. CONSEQUENTLY FISHER IS OCCASIONALLY CRITICISED FOR STEALING OTHER PEOPLES IDEAS, WHILE AMASSING THE CREDIT FOR HIMSELF, HE WAS CERTAINLY ADEPT AT SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH THE MOST ABLE OF MEN. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY EVIDENT IN THE BRILLIANT APPOINTMENT OF J. A. EWING, PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, TO THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED POST OF DIRECTOR OF NAVAL EDUCATION.
THE ADMIRALTY SCHEME FOR THE ENTRY AND TRAINING OF OFFICER CADETS, WARRANT OFFICERS, PETTY OFFICERS AND MEN, WAS PUBLISHED ON DECEMBER 25TH 1902. IT COMMENCED WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT THE NAVY HAS REACHED A CRITICAL PERIOD IN ITS DEVELOPMENT  A DEVELOPMENT WHICH, STEADY AND COMPARATIVELY SLOW FOR THE GREATER PART OF THE LAST CENTURY, HAS NOW FOR FIFTEEN YEARS PROCEEDED WITH STARTLING RAPIDITY. DURING THIS PERIOD STEAM HAD REPLACED SAIL, WOOD HAD BEEN SUPERSEDED BY IRON THEN STEEL, AND CANNON REPLACED BY QUICK-FIRING GUNS. THE NUMBER OF OFFICERS AND MEN IN THE ROYAL NAVY AND ROYAL MARINES HAD MORE THAN DOUBLED FROM 60,000 TO OVER 120,000, WHILE A NUMBER OF FOREIGN NAVIES WERE NOW MORE POWERFUL THAN THE BRITISH NAVY HAD BEEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, ALTHOUGH THE ROYAL NAVY REMAINED SUPREME.
IN PARTICULAR IT WAS NECESSARY TO RECOGNISE, WITH THE DEMISE OF MASTS AND YARDS, THE GROWING IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERING. ENGINEERING, PRACTICAL AND THEORETICAL, WAS TO BE OF GREATER IMPORTANCE TO ALL NAVAL OFFICERS. MOREOVER EXECUTIVE, ENGINEER AND ROYAL MARINE OFFICERS WOULD ALL RECEIVE THE SAME TRAINING AND EDUCATION UNTIL THEY REACHED THE RANK OF SUB-LIEUTENANT, AT THE AGE OF ABOUT TWENTY, WHEN THEY COULD SELECT THEIR PREFERRED BRANCH, BASED UPON THEIR ORIGINAL PREFERENCES AS STATED ON ENTRY. ALL OFFICER CADETS WOULD THEREFORE JOIN UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS.
ENTRY UNDER THE NEW SCHEME WAS TO BE BY NOMINATION FOLLOWING A SUITABILITY INTERVIEW, A QUALIFYING EXAMINATION AND A MEDICAL. IT WAS INTENDED TO END THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE BRITANNIA EXAM, WHICH HAD ENCOURAGED CRAMMING AND SUBSEQUENTLY MENTAL EXHAUSTION AMONG CADETS. THE EXAMINATION WHICH FOLLOWED THE APPROVAL OF THE FIRST SEA LORD AS TO THE BOYS SUITABILITY, AIMED TO ENSURE A LEVEL OF ACADEMIC ABILITY. THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ALLOW OPEN COMPETITION, ENABLING THE BEST POSSIBLE CANDIDATES TO COME FORWARD, PROVIDING THEIR PARENTS COULD AFFORD THE FEES. FOR DARTMOUTH WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL, RUN BY THE NAVY; ITS PUPILS WERE NOT YET IN THE NAVY, BUT THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE SCHOOL WAS TO PROVIDE THE NAVY WITH SPECIALLY EDUCATED BOYS WHO WOULD BECOME THE OFFICERS OF THE FUTURE. FISHER HIMSELF HAD RESERVATIONS ABOUT CHARGING FEES FOR A NAVAL EDUCATION (A SUM OF 75 PER ANNUM PLUS COST OF UNIFORM AND OTHER KIT AND EQUIPMENT), RESTRICTING THE POOL OF FUTURE NELSONS, BUT THE SYSTEM WAS IN FACT DESIGNED TO CATCH A PARTICULAR TYPE OF BOY FROM A PARTICULAR MIDDLE TO UPPER CLASS BACKGROUND. THE AIM TO ABOLISH THE CLASS DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE EXECUTIVE AND ENGINEERING BRANCHES SHOULD PERHAPS BE MORE ACCURATELY INTERPRETED AS ATTEMPTING TO DRAW BOTH FROM THE SAME CLASS, RATHER THAN EXTENDING ENTRY TO THE LOWER CLASSES.
HAVING SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THE SELECTION PROCEDURE CADETS WOULD SPEND FOUR YEARS AT THE ROYAL NAVAL COLLEGE. DURING THIS TIME, AS PROFESSOR EWING EXPLAINED IN 1906, THEY WOULD RECEIVE A GENERAL EDUCATION ON MODERN LINES WHICH SHOULD INCLUDE AN EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE ELEMENT OF PRACTICAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING.2 THE CURRICULUM WHICH, ACCORDING TO EWING, WOULD RESEMBLE THAT OF A GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOL, COVERED INSTRUCTION IN MATHEMATICS, HEAT, ELECTRICITY; IN THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF ENGINEERING; IN FRENCH [PLUS GERMAN FOR THE MORE ABLE], ENGLISH COMPOSITION AND LITERATURE; IN HISTORY, BOTH GENERAL AND NAVAL; IN GEOGRAPHY, NAVIGATION AND THE ELEMENTS OF SEAMANSHIP; AND IN RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE. A GOOD DEAL OF TIME WOULD ALSO BE SPENT IN WORKSHOPS, INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN CARPENTERING AND PATTERN MAKING, IN TURNING, MOULDING AND CASTING, IN BLACKSMITHING AND COPPERSMITHING, AND IN MECHANICAL DRAWING. THE RESULT WAS TO PROVIDE AN EDUCATION FOR THE BOY WHO IS TO BECOME A MAN OF ACTION, NOT A PHILOSOPHER.3
INEVITABLY, GIVEN THE EXTENT OF THE REFORMS BEING PROPOSED, FISHER AND SELBORNE WERE MET WITH CRITICISM AND OPPOSITION FOR THEIR SCHEME. OBJECTIONS CENTRED ROUND THE COMMON TRAINING OF EXECUTIVE AND ENGINEER OFFICERS. MUCH OF THE DETRACTORS OPPOSITION SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN BASED ON SHEER SNOBBERY, NOT WISHING TO TAINT THE GLORY OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER WITH THE OIL, GRIME, AND HEAT OF THE ENGINE-ROOM.4 INDEED THE TIMES JOURNALIST JAMES THURSFIELD, WROTE TO FISHER TELLING HIM OF A CONVERSATION WITH LORD SPENCER WHO HAD BEEN APPROACHED BY A DISTINGUISHED PERSON TO LEAD AN ATTACK ON THE SCHEME. WHEN LORD SPENCER REFUSED TO DO SO, THE ANONYMOUS GREAT MAN REPLIED; ARE YOU PREPARED TO DEFEND OUR OFFICERS GOING DOWN IN THE COAL HOLE?5 BUT UNDERLYING THIS THERE WAS A GENUINE CONCERN ABOUT INTERCHANGEABLITY BETWEEN THE BRANCHES REDUCING THE DEGREE OF SPECIALIST KNOWLEDGE ON BOARD SHIP. THE INTENTION, HOWEVER, WAS MERELY TO GIVE DECK OFFICERS SUFFICIENT ENGINEERING AND SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORKINGS OF THEIR SHIPS AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS, WHILE PROVIDING ENGINEERS (AND MARINES) WITH AN APPRECIATION OF THE ART OF SEAMANSHIP.
NOT ALL CONTEMPORARY OPINION WAS AGAINST THE FISHER-SELBORNE SCHEME. THE PRINCE OF WALES, A FORMER BRITANNIA CADET, WROTE TO FISHER:
I CALL IT A GRAND SCHEME AND WISH IT EVERY SUCCESS. NO DOUBT IT WILL BE SEVERELY CRITICISED BY THE OLD ONES, WHO ARE TOO CONSERVATIVE FOR OUR MODERN DAYS I AM CERTAIN THE NAVY WILL GREATLY BENEFIT BY HAVING YOUR ENGINEER AND MARINE OFFICERS DRAWN FROM THE SAME CLASS AS YOUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 6
EVEN ADMIRAL LORD CHARLES BERESFORD, WITH WHOM FISHER WAS LATER TO FALL OUT OVER HIS WAR PLANS, DESCRIBED THE SCHEME AS A BRILLIANT AND STATESMANLIKE EFFORT TO GRAPPLE WITH A PROBLEM UPON THE SOUND SETTLEMENT OF WHICH DEPENDS THE FUTURE EFFICIENCY OF THE BRITISH NAVY. 7
THAT THE SCHEME FOUGHT FOR BY FISHER AND SELBORNE LASTED FOR ALMOST HALF A CENTURY IS A MARK OF THE FORETHOUGHT THAT HAD CONTRIBUTED TO A UNIQUE SYSTEM OF NAVAL EDUCATION. ARGUABLY MANY OF ITS ORIGINAL OBJECTIVES FAILED TO TRANSPIRE; ENGINEERS WERE TO REMAIN AT A DISADVANTAGE AND AFTER 1921 WERE NOT GENERALLY TO RECEIVE A DARTMOUTH EDUCATION, WHILE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF OFFICERS OF ALL BRANCHES WERE TO ENTER THE SERVICE VIA THE SPECIAL ENTRY AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN, TOO OLD TO BE PROPERLY MOULDED FOR LIFE AT SEA. NEVERTHELESS DARTMOUTH HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY ESTABLISHED AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL FOR NAVAL OFFICERS, IN WHICH IT WAS POSSIBLE TO COMBINE THE STAFF AND CURRICULUM FOR WHAT WAS RECOGNISED AS A GOOD GENERAL EDUCATION WITH THE UNIQUE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING THE NAVY REQUIRED.

TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND REVERSING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT TASKS FACING THE WORLD IN THE 21ST CENTURY. UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGE OF SUSTAINABILITY THROUGH INTER-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN KEY AREAS, INCLUDING CLIMATE SCIENCE, SOILS, EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY; WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH; CLEAN ENERGY, ENERGY USAGE AND SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAINS; AND ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE.
AS A UNIVERSITY CREATED BY ITS COMMUNITY FOR ITS COMMUNITY TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES, WE UNDERSTAND THE VITAL ROLE EDUCATION AND SCHOLARSHIP PLAY IN ENSURING THAT IN OUR RAPIDLY-CHANGING WORLD, NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND.
OUR WORLD IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES, AND WE ALSO SEE RAPID CHANGE IN THE WORLDS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ORDER. THIS POSES A THREAT TO OUR SECURITY AND WELLBEING, AND LAW PROVIDES A STEADYING FORCE, A SYSTEM FOR PRIORITISING AND A SYSTEM FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES. LAWS ABILITY TO FULFIL THESE FUNCTIONS RESTS ON ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE NEW NORMS AND MAINTAIN EXISTING ONES, BUT IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD ITS ABILITY TO DO SO IS TESTED.
ELIZABETHS RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS WEAKNESSES IN CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NORMATIVITY IS PRODUCED (THE PROCESSES BY WHICH WE COME TO REGARD RULES AS BINDING) IN BOTH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PROVIDES METHODS FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES. WITH THIS UNDERSTANDING IN PLACE IT MAY BECOME POSSIBLE TO CREATE MORE RESILIENT LEGAL SYSTEMS ABLE TO PROVIDE CERTAINTY AND SECURITY IN CHALLENGING TIMES.
ELIZABETHS RESEARCH HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY A NUMBER OF RESEARCH GRANTS FROM THE AHRC, BRITISH ACADEMY, ESRC, EUROPEAN COMMISSION, ROYAL SOCIETY OF EDINBURGH AND SOCIETY OF LEGAL SCHOLARS. HER RESEARCH AIMS TO TRANSFORM OUR UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE THEORETICAL DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY ARE IRRELEVANT IN EXPLAINING THE PRODUCTION OF NORMATIVITY.
THE LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE
THE LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE (LINCEJ) AIMS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BEST TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN HUMAN AND INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOUR TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO OUR PLANET, WHICH WILL REQUIRE NEW FORMS OF RESEARCH, WITH NEW SYNERGIES FROM INTERDISCIPLINARY, CROSS-SCALE RESEARCH IN LAW, THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, AND THE HUMANITIES.
ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ARE UBIQUITOUS SOIL ORGANISMS THAT COLONISE THE ROOTS OF MOST PLANT SPECIES. THESE IMPORTANT PLANT SYMBIONTS USUALLY ENHANCE PLANT GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION BY DELIVERING WATER AND NUTRIENTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOIL IN EXCHANGE FOR CARBOHYDRATES PHOTOSYNTHESISED BY THE PLANTS. THE RELATIONSHIP IS USUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH PARTNERS: FUNGI ARE FULLY DEPENDENT ON THE PLANT FOR CARBON WHILST PLANTS INCREASE THEIR NUTRIENT ACQUISITION AND ARE THEREFORE BIGGER AND BETTER PROTECTED FROM ABIOTIC (E.G. DROUGHT) AND BIOTIC (E.G. PLANT PATHOGENS) STRESSES.
THE SCHOOL OF LIFE SCIENCES HAS SEVERAL ONGOING STUDIES INVESTIGATING NOT ONLY HOW THESE FUNGI AFFECT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF PLANT GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION, BUT ALSO HOW THEY AFFECT OTHER ORGANISMS INTERACTING WITH PLANTS SUCH AS POLLINATORS. ONE OF THESES STUDIES USES KNAUTIA ARVENSIS (FIELD SCABIOUS) TO INVESTIGATE HOW DIFFERENT ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGAL COMMUNITIES AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF FLOWERS AND FLORAL REWARDS OFFERED TO POLLINATORS (I.E. NECTAR AND POLLEN), AND HOW POLLINATORS MAY RESPOND TO THESE DIFFERENCES.
UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLANTS AND ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE FUNGI DIRECTLY INFLUENCE PLANT PERFORMANCE AND MAY ALSO AFFECT THE DIVERSITY AND COMPOSITION OF NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND ITS COMPONENTS.
A PIONEERING NEW RESEARCH COLLABORATION FEATURING NINE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND THREE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES SPANNING SIX DIFFERENT COUNTRIES IS SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OBJECTIVES OF GROWERS ACROSS THE NORTH SEA REGION USING THE NEWEST TECHNOLOGIES.
SINCE 2018, WAYNE HAS LED THE FOOD INSIGHTS AND SUSTAINABILITY RESEARCH GROUP AT THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR FOOD MANUFACTURING (NCFM). THE CENTRE IS DEVELOPING WORLD-LEADING SUSTAINABLE COOKING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING STEAM INFUSION. STEAM INFUSION LOWERS THE ENERGY REQUIRED TO HEAT FOODS AND PASTEURISE THEM TO MAKE THEM SAFE. IT HEATS MUCH QUICKER THAN DIRECT HEATING AND IT PRESERVES SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS OF FOODS. THE TECHNOLOGY CAN REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF FOOD PROCESSING AND MOVE PRODUCTS TO CARBON ZERO TARGETS REQUIRED BY THE UKS ENVIRONMENT PLAN.
S APPROACH IS TO WORK WITH COMPANIES TO BUILD SUSTAINABILITY INTO PRODUCTS FROM SOURCING, RECIPES, PACKAGING THROUGH TO THE CONSUMER. THE CENTRE'S RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES ZERO FOOD WASTE FOR EVERY MEAL IS POSSIBLE IF FOOD PRESERVATION IS USED WELL. THIS WORK IS IN COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA BOKU AND PART OF THE EC FUNDED FOOD HEROES PROJECT. A BALANCED DIET THAT REDUCES LIVESTOCK PRODUCT CONSUMPTION TO HEALTHY LEVELS CAN REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF DIETS BY AT LEAST 20%, AND REDUCE FOOD WASTE BY UP TO 80%.", 'THE CENTRE IS ALSO WORKING ON COMMUNICATING AND CHANGING CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOURS BY HIGHLIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS OF FOOD CONSUMPTION AND WASTE.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE UNIVERSITYS CARBON FOOTPRINT IS THE USE OF ENERGY IN OUR BUILDINGS. IN 2019/20, THIS ACCOUNTED FOR 48% OF OUR TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS (CO2E).
OUR SUSTAINABILITY TEAM, BASED IN THE ESTATES DEPARTMENT, IS WORKING HARD TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND UTILISE OUR ESTATE AS A RESOURCE TO IMPROVE BIODIVERSITY AND SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS. THIS TEAM SUPPORTS THE UNIVERSITY TO MAINTAIN THE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED ISO14001 STANDARD FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT, THE ISO5001 STANDARD FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT, AND THE ECOCAMPUS PLATINUM AWARD.

THE BUILDING HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY ENERGY MODELLED TO ENSURE THAT THE EQUIPMENT RUNNING THE HEATING, COOLING, AND VENTILATION TAKES INTO ACCOUNT HOW OUR UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS ARE USED. THIS INCLUDES SEASONAL CHANGES SUCH AS TERM TIME TEACHING, MAXIMISING NATURAL VENTILATION TO REDUCE THE REQUIREMENT OF MECHANICAL VENTILATION. DAYLIGHT DIMMING IS ALSO IN PLACE IN MANY AREAS OF THE LIGHTING ACROSS THE BUILDING  WHEN NATURAL DAYLIGHT LEVELS ARE HIGH ENOUGH, THE LIGHTING INSIDE THE BUILDING WILL ADJUST TO SUIT OR SWITCH OFF ALTOGETHER.
THE BUILDING IS ALSO FULLY RUN ON ELECTRICITY AS THE GRID IS NATURALLY BEING DE-CARBONISED. THE BUILDING IS EXTENSIVELY ENERGY METERED AND OUR ESTATES TEAM HAVE SUPPORT FROM A CONSULTANT FOR THE NEXT 3 YEARS IN MONITORING THE ENERGY USE IN SPACES AND WORKING WITH THE BUILDING USERS TO IMPROVE THIS WHERE POSSIBLE.

THE LINCOLN SWAN PROJECT
MUTE SWANS ARE AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL OF THE CITY OF LINCOLN, DATING BACK TO THE REBUILDING OF LINCOLN CATHEDRAL IN 1185. HISTORICALLY, LARGE JUVENILE GROUPS WOULD OVER-WINTER ON THEBRAYFORD, BUT RECENT SURVEYS SUGGEST THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE DECLINING. MANYENVIRONMENTALFACTORS MAY DRIVE THISAPPARENTDECLINE, SUCH AS A DECREASED FOOD AVAILABILITY, AGGRESSION BETWEEN SWANS FOR TERRITORY, OR FISHING LINESOR LEAD WEIGHTS IN THE WATERWAYS.
IN 2017 WE STARTED A PROGRAMME OF COLOUR RINGING SWANS ON THE WATERWAYS IN AND AROUND LINCOLN, FUNDED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AND WITH ASSISTANCE FROM THE WILDFOWL AND WETLANDS TRUST AND THE YORKSHIRE SWAN AND WILDLIFE RESCUE HOSPITAL. WE HAVE NOW RINGED OVER 200 SWANS IN AND AROUND LINCOLN AND ARE STARTING TO GET SOME GREAT DATA ONRESIGHTINGS. 
IN 2020, WE DEVELOPED A COMMUNITY SCIENCE PROJECT USING A PHONE APP TO ALLOW MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO REGISTER WITH THE PROJECT AND SUBMIT THEIR SWAN SIGHTINGS.

THE ELEANOR GLANVILLE INSTITUTE IS THE UNIVERSITYS STRATEGIC LEAD FOR EDI. IT PROVIDES THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE ON EDI TO INFORM AND SHAPE STRUCTURES, POLICIES, AND PRACTICES ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY.
IN 2012, WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO CONSIDER HOW TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY ACROSS THE INSTITUTION, IT WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT WE WOULD NEED TO ADOPT A NEW APPROACH TO EFFECT ANY CHANGE. OVER 30 YEARS OF SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN TRADITIONAL EQUALITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION (EDI) FAILED TO CREATE A FULLY DIVERSE WORKFORCE IN THE UK. FROM THE OUTSET, OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES HAVE BEEN TO UNDERPIN THE PRACTICE OF EDI WITH FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH, BUILDING PRACTITIONERRESEARCHER COLLABORATIONS THAT ASK THE QUESTIONS, DEVELOPING DISRUPTIVE AND TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE INEQUALITIES THAT EXIST, AND DEVELOPING THE MECHANISMS TO MEASURE CHANGE AND IMPACT. TO DO THAT EFFICIENTLY, WE NEED TO ALL WORK TOGETHER THROUGH A HOLISTIC, SYSTEMS-BASED, AND COORDINATED APPROACH ACROSS THE WHOLE INSTITUTION.
TEN YEARS ON, WE HAVE A THRIVING  AND IM PROUD TO SAY A FULLY DIVERSE  POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH COMMUNITY, WITH JUST OVER HALF (54%) OF OUR RESEARCH STUDENTS FROM ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS, AND JUST UNDER HALF (47%) OF OUR STUDENTS ARE MALE. WE ARE NOW BUILDING OUR POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT PROVISION AND DEVELOPING A SERIES OF FLEXIBLE EDI EDUCATION MODULES CALLED MICROCREDENTIALS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE CORNERSTONE OF EXPERT EDUCATION ACROSS THE EDI FIELD.

SOME SELECTED HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS PROJECT AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SDGS ARE OUTLINED BELOW: 
WE WERE FUNDED VIA UKRI NEWTON FUND FOR PROJECT MOBILE ARTS FOR PEACE'S PROJECT MAP AT HOME, WHICH LOOKED ATONLINE PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT THROUGH THE ARTS IN RWANDA. THIS PROJECT AIMED TO CONNECT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE USERS AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS USING LOCALLY INFORMED APPROACHES TO MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING. THIS INITIATIVE HAS SCALED UP TO A NATIONAL LEVEL IN RELATION TO INFORMING THE MENTAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS PROGRAMME AND TRAINING IN HOSPITALS AND HEALTH CENTRES USING ARTS-BASED APPROACHES. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING WITHIN THE LARGER MAP NETWORK PLUS PROJECT.
WE HAVE INFORMED CURRICULA THROUGH AMAP CPD PROGRAMME IN RWANDA,THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILD CLUBS IN KYRGYZSTAN, RWANDA, INDONESIA, AND NEPAL, AND THE CREATION OF LOCAL CURRICULUM INNEPALAND INDONESIA. WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY WORKING WITH UNESCO IN RELATION TO INFORMING ARTS-EDUCATION IN NEPAL, AND HAVE JUST LAUNCHED A MAP UNESCO EVENT THAT INCLUDED MINISTERS, IO AND NGO OFFICIALS, ALONGSIDE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ARTISTS AND YOUTH RESEARCHERS. THERE HAVE BEEN 'ARTS DIALOGUE' FORUMS THAT FOCUS ON COMMUNICATING THE NEEDS/ISSUES OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO DECISION-MAKERS. THIS INCLUDES LOCAL MAP RESEARCHER CLUBS THAT AREESTABLISHEDIN SCHOOLS/OUT OF SCHOOL SETTINGS AND HAS INVOLVED A TRAINING OF TRAINERS FOR TEACHERS/YOUTH WORKERS/YOUNG PEOPLE (EX: 7 CHILD CLUBS IN NEPAL, 18 YOUTH RESEARCHER CLUBS IN KYRGYZSTAN, 45 CLUBS IN RWANDA, AND WORKING WITH STREET CONNECTED YOUTH VIA YOUTH FOCUSED ORGANISATIONS IN INDONESIA).
WE HAVE CREATED A YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD THAT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF YOUNG WOMEN WHO HAVE ADDRESSED ISSUES OF GENDER EQUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OF THE 32 YOUTH-LED SMALL GRANT PROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED BY MAP FOCUSED ON GENDER EQUALITY SUCH AS GIRLS' ACCESS TO EDUCATION. ONE OF OUR PROJECTS ONE DRUM USES DRUMMING FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN TO DRUM THEIR ISSUES AND TO TRANSFORM CULTURE THROUGH FESTIVALS THAT INVOLVE DECISION-MAKERS. SINCE DRUMMING HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN RESTRICTED TO MEN, THE FACT THAT GIRLS AND WOMEN ARE USING DRUMMING AS A FORM OF EXPRESSION IS IN ITSELF A STEP TOWARDS GENDER EQUALITY AS PERCEIVED WITHIN RWANDAN CULTURE.
WE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE USE OF LOCAL ARTS-BASED METHODS. OFTEN, THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH MARGINALISED COMMUNITIES TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND THE ARTS-BASED OUTPUTS EXPRESS ISSUES/NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED BY THEM TO BE COMMUNICATED TO DECISION-MAKERS. WE HAVE ALSO WORKED WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO INFORM CURRICULUM AND POLICY.

 A TALE OF TWO CITIES: UNDERSTANDING THE PERCEPTIONS AND BARRIERS TO TACKLING THE UK HOUSING CRISIS IN LINCOLN AND DONCASTER
FOR THE BEST PART OF TWO DECADES, THE UK HAS UNDERDELIVERED ON BUILDING NEW HOUSING. THE UK NOW NEEDS AN ADDITIONAL 345,000 NEW HOMES EACH YEAR, TO ACCOMMODATE ITS GROWING POPULATION. CONSEQUENTLY, HOUSE PRICES HAVE INCREASED BY 44% SINCE THE 2008 GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS AND ARE CONTINUING TO RISE. HOUSING IS A FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF SOCIAL MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY, YET THE UK HAS PERSISTENTLY STRUGGLED TO DEVELOP THE REQUIRED AMOUNT TO NEW HOUSING TO SUPPORT POPULATION GROWTH.
NIMBYISM (NOT-IN-MY-BACK-YARD-ISM) IS BELIEVED TO HAVE INFLUENCED POLITICAL RESISTANCE TO DEVELOP NEW HOUSING IN THE REGIONS THAT NEED IT MOST. THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE NIMBY ATTITUDES IN THE UK, AND HOW FACTORS VARY BETWEEN GROUPS BY AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND REGION.
UNDERSTANDING NIMBY ATTITUDES WILL ALLOW PLANNING SPECIALISTS, URBAN DEVELOPERS, AND GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO BUILDING NEW HOUSING TO HELP EASE THE NATIONAL HOUSING CRISIS. THE RESEARCH CONSIDERS HOW ATTITUDES MIGHT VARY BETWEEN TWO CITIES IN BOTH LINCOLN, IN THE EAST MIDLANDS AND DONCASTER, SOUTH YORKSHIRE, WITH THE AIM TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT MIGHT VARY SPATIALLY. EASING THIS CRISIS IS NECESSARY TO IMPROVE SOCIAL MOBILITY, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND HELP LIFT A GENERATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF THE RENTING FRAMEWORK AND INTO HOME OWNERSHIP.
EVALUATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANISATION AND DENGUE FEVER IN MALAYSIA -GRACE ATKIN
WITHOUT THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING, THE DISTRIBUTION AND CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES CAN BE HARD TO MANAGE. ONE OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE IS DENGUE FEVER WHICH AFFECTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ANNUALLY. ALTHOUGH DENGUE FEVER IS NOT LIFE-THREATENING, IT CAN POTENTIALLY TURN INTO A SEVERE, FATAL FORM KNOWN AS DENGUE HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE REQUIREMENT TO RAISE AWARENESS TO MITIGATE TRANSMISSION.
THE DISEASE HAS BECOME FURTHER DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE GLOBE WITH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY THROUGH TRANSPORT AND TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY IN SUBTROPICAL AND TROPICAL REGIONS SUCH AS SOUTH EAST ASIA. FURTHERMORE, IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES SUCH AS MALAYSIA, AN INCREASE IN URBANISATION PROCESSES HAS PROVIDED IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR THE VECTORS TO THRIVE. THIS STUDY AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DENGUE INCIDENCE AND THE ROLE OF URBAN AND SEMI-URBAN AREAS IN MALAYSIA. HOWEVER, THE STUDY ALSO CONSIDERS OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS SUCH AS CLIMATE INFLUENCES AND THE ROLE OF GOVERNANCE AND HOW THESE FURTHER IMPACT MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URBANISATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF DISEASE, THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF COUNTRY-SPECIFIC, CASE STUDY ACCOUNTS WHICH INCLUDE AN ANALYSIS OF MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES. THIS RESEARCH INVOLVES A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH LITERATURE, OFFICIAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS ALONGSIDE QUANTITATIVE METHODS EXAMINING CASE NUMBERS, DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS. THIS COMBINATION PROVIDES A THOROUGH INSIGHT INTO THE REALITY OF MALAYSIAS EXPERIENCES WITH DENGUE FEVER THROUGHOUT THE PAST TWO DECADES.
EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FORMAL AND NON-FORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP- SOSEALA TINILAU
TUVALU AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS RELY ON BIODIVERSITY AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES, BOTH OF WHICH ARE THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. A CRITICAL IMPEDIMENT TO STRENGTHENING NATIONAL RESILIENT DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A LACK OF CAPACITY AND COMPETENCE AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF SUSTAINABLE APPROVED AND QUALITY-ASSURED FORMAL TRAINING PROGRAMS AT THE VOCATIONAL LEVEL. AS A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED ROADBLOCKS, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FORMAL AND NON-FORMAL ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP TRAINING AND DEVELOPING AND TESTING AN ACCEPTABLE APPROACH FOR EXAMINING EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS ON ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP.
S CONCLUSION.", 'TUVALUS CLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP EDUCATION ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THE STUDY. DONORS AND ASSISTANCE AGENCIES WILL BENEFIT FROM THE STUDYS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADEQUATE TRAINING AND ACCREDITATION TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP. THE STUDY WILL ALSO PROVIDE FRESH THEORETICAL INSIGHTS INTO HOW DEVELOPING COUNTRY CLIMATE PEDAGOGY IS MANAGED.
EXAMINING THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN THE UK-OLIVIA WHYTE
THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS 2 (SARS-COV-2), AND THE GLOBAL SPREAD OF THE 2019 NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19) HAS ARGUABLY IMPACTED PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE LIKE NO OTHER EVENT OF THE 21STCENTURY. WHILE EFFORTS TO CURB THE RISE OF CASES AND DEATHS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED, SUCH AS THE ROLLOUT OF VACCINATIONS, THE ACTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN LIMITING THE RISK AND SPREAD OF THE VIRUS.
THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO EXPLORE INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOUR DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND EXPLORE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE BEHAVIOURS OF THE UK PUBLIC. THE BEHAVIOURS BEING INVESTIGATED INCLUDE THE USE OF FACE COVERINGS AND ABIDANCE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING, HOUSEHOLD MIXING, AND SELF-ISOLATION RULES IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT ACROSS DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS OF THE PANDEMIC.
ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETING FACTORS/THEORIES WHICH MAY MOTIVATE BEHAVIOURS DURING A PANDEMIC, INCLUDING COGNITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS PSYCHOLOGICAL CLOSENESS, MORAL RESPONSIBILITY, SOCIAL NORMS, RISK, KNOWLEDGE AND TRUST, AS WELL AS PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING LEGAL COMPLIANCE AND POLICY. THEREFORE, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN FACTORS AND ASSOCIATED THEORIES WHICH EXPLAIN THE BEHAVIOURS OF THE UK PUBLIC. THE METHODOLOGY OF THIS RESEARCH TAKES A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH, AND THE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY THAT GAINED 203 PARTICIPANTS OVER THE COURSE OF THREE MONTHS. THE RESULTS OF THIS RESEARCH WILL BE DERIVED FROM STATISTICAL AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS.

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOCIAL DISADVANTAGE AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ARE WELL DOCUMENTED IN SOME MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD BUT LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT UNFAIR AND UNEVEN DEVELOPMENT OVER SPACE AND TIME IN MOST COUNTRIES. THE INEQUALITIES CLUSTER ENCOURAGES BOTH CRITICALLY ENGAGED TECHNICAL WORK AND TECHNICALLY CAPABLE CRITICAL WORK. OUR WORK EMBRACES QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SOCIAL RESEARCH PRACTICE TO PROVIDE CLARITY ABOUT THE BEST ROUTES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND TACKLING INEQUALITIES THROUGH AN INTERDISCIPLINARY AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE. OUR CURRENT PROJECTS INCLUDE EXPLORING THE FACTORS THAT EXPLAIN INEQUALITY AND THE IMPACT ON VULNERABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC. DIRE MEMBERS IN THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY AND SCHOOL OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE ARE ENGAGED IN ONGOING REAL-TIME RESEARCH ABOUT HOW DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES INCREASED THE VULNERABILITY OF SOME GROUPS IN SOCIETY TO BIOLOGICAL CONTAGION AND ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC. OTHER AREAS OF RESEARCH INCLUDE HOW SOCIO-ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE REFLECTED IN POLICY-MAKING, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSES TO BIODIVERSITY LOSS AND SEA LEVEL RISE.

IN RECENT YEARS, WATERBORNE AND VECTOR-BORNE PARASITIC AND BACTERIAL DISEASES HAVE EMERGED ORRE-EMERGED IN MANY GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS, CAUSING GLOBAL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. THE ECOLOGY ANDEPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATERBORNE AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES ARE AFFECTED BY THE INTERRELATIONS BETWEENTHREE MAIN FACTORS COMPRISING THE PATHOGEN, THE HOST, AND THE ENVIRONMENT. LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTHRESEARCHERS AREINTERESTED IN THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF DISEASES ON HUMAN HEALTH.
HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF EPIDEMIC DISEASE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO TEST THE KEY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS SPREAD, SEVERITY, AND VARYING DEGREES OF HUMAN SUSCEPTIBILITY. EPIDEMIC DISEASE WAS RECONSTRUCTED FROM PARISH REGISTERS OF BURIALS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE WAS SYSTEMATIC RECORDING OF MORTALITY IN ENGLAND. LCWPH RESEARCHERS ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE ROLE OF EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND CLIMATIC CHANGE IN THE OUTBREAK, SPREAD, AND SEVERITY OF EPIDEMICS.
UNDERSTANDING A LANDSCAPE EPIDEMIOLOGY SYSTEM REQUIRES MORE THAN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS (HOST, VECTOR, AND PATHOGEN) THAT COMPRISE THE SYSTEM. IT ALSOREQUIRES UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INDIVIDUALS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. TWOMOSQUITO-CONTROL INTERVENTIONS WERE MODELLED USING GIS AND AN ABM FOR A STUDY SITE IN KENYA. LCWPH RESEARCHERS ARE INTERESTED IN INTEGRATING DATA FROM SOCIAL MEDIA AND APPS TO CREATE A DYNAMIC ABM MODEL.
THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY COLLABORATES WITH THE LINCOLN INSTITUTE FOR AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY (LIAT) ON A NUMBER OF INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS INVOLVING ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, CLIMATE CHANGE, CROPS, WATER AND SOIL HEALTH.

ON THIS PAGE YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECTS CURRENTLY BEING UNDERTAKEN IN THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY. THE KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMME IS TO FIND A RESEARCH SUBJECT THAT YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT, AND A SUPERVISORY TEAM THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA.
THE FIRST THING THAT ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN UNDERTAKING RESEARCH WITH US SHOULD DO IS DIRECTLY CONTACT A MEMBER OF STAFF WHO WORKS IN AN AREA THAT THEY ARE INTERESTED IN. WE HAVE WIDE AREAS OF EXPERTISE IN THE SCHOOL SPANNING CLIMATE CHANGE, RIVER AND COASTAL PROCESSES AND POLLUTION, WATERBORNE DISEASES, BIOGEOGRAPHY, ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR, RURAL ECONOMY, SOCIAL AND POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY, DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, AND MORE.
COASTAL EROSION AND COASTAL FLOODING RANGE ARE AMONG THE MOST SEVERE CONCERNS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES. IN THE FUTURE, SEA-LEVEL RISE (SLR) INCREASES THE RISK OF LOSS OF LAND, ASSETS, AND LIVES. THE RESILIENCE OF COASTAL SYSTEMS TO SLR, TO A LARGE EXTENT, IS CONTROLLED BY COASTAL SEDIMENT AVAILABILITY, BEING HEAVILY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATIONS IN THE RIVER CATCHMENTS.LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH INTEGRATES RIVERINE AND COASTAL RESEARCH TO UNRAVEL THE INTERACTIONS AND FEEDBACK MECHANISMS BETWEEN COASTS AND CATCHMENTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RESILIENCE OF NATURAL AND SOCIAL COASTAL SYSTEMS.
SEDIMENT DELIVERY IN RIVER CATCHMENTS IS REDUCED BY AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RIVER DAMS FOR WATER SUPPLY AND ENERGY PRODUCTION. MEANWHILE, ONGOING LAND USE CHANGES (E.G. DEFORESTATION) MAY INCREASE RIVERINE SEDIMENT DELIVERY INTO THE COASTAL ZONE.
WHERE SUFFICIENT SEDIMENT IS AVAILABLE, COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS MAY ESTABLISH AND FACILITATE LAND BUILDING AND LAND RAISING THROUGH VERTICAL SEDIMENT ACCRETION.
MARINE AND RIVERINE FORCES SHAPE THE MORPHOLOGY OF RIVER MOUTH SYSTEMS, SUCH AS DELTAS AND ESTUARIES. DELTAS AND ESTUARIES ARE GLOBAL POPULATION HOTSPOTS AT RISK FROM RIVERINE, COASTAL AND COMPOUND FLOODING EVENTS AS WELL AS COASTAL EROSION.

RIVERS SATISFY MULTIPLE SOCIAL NEEDS IN TERMS OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES. YET, THEY ARE AFFECTED BY A WIDE DEGREE OF HUMAN IMPACTS, WHICH REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL SERVICES THAT RIVERS PROVIDE, AND ARE OFTEN IN NEED OF RESTORATION.LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH IS COMMITTED TO TACKLING THESE ISSUES IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY FRAMEWORK OF RIVER SCIENCE, WHICH STANDS AT THE INTERFACE OF GEOMORPHOLOGY, ECOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. SUSTAINABLE RIVER MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A PARADIGM THAT CONSIDERS SOCIAL-ECO-HYDRO-MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND FEEDBACKS DETERMINING RIVER FUNCTIONING.
OUR AIM IS TO CHARACTERISE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SEDIMENT SOURCES AT THE BASIN SCALE, CONNECTIVITY, SEDIMENT FLUXES, AND RIVER MORPHODYNAMICS, AND TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT OF HUMAN INTERVENTIONS ON FLUVIAL DYNAMICS.

RURAL VISIONS | RESEARCH | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNRURAL VISIONS IS A COLLABORATION OF RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN EMBRACING AN ECLECTIC RANGE OF EXPERTISE SPANNING RURAL ECONOMICS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, LANDSCAPE HISTORIES, DEMOGRAPHY, ANIMALS AND NATURE, ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, RURAL POVERTY AND THE IMPACTS OF TECHNOLOGY. OUR WORK IS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING UNDERSTANDING OF RURAL PLACES AND INFORMING ACTION TO ENHANCE LIVES IN RURAL PLACES.
RURAL ECONOMIES ARE EVOLVING THANKS TO NEW MIGRATION FLOWS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND ENHANCED URBAN-RURAL CONNECTIVITY. NEW OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY VISIONARY ENTREPRENEURS AND INNOVATORS ARE ESSENTIAL TO SUSTAIN THE VITALITY OF RURAL PLACES.
RURAL LANDSCAPES AND RURAL BUILT ENVIRONMENTS ARE OFTEN CHERISHED AS PART OF A NATIONAL IDENTITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE UK. THE IDYLLIC RURAL VISIONS THAT ARE PORTRAYED, HOWEVER, DO NOT REFLECT ALL TYPES OF RURALITY, SO A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POWER OF RURAL REPRESENTATIONS AND IMAGERY IS ESSENTIAL TO INFORM RURAL RESEARCH.
THIS THEME OF OUR RESEARCH IS ABOUT CREATING A VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF RURAL PLACES. HOW CAN GOVERNMENT AT DIFFERENT SCALES DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT WILL MOVE TOWARDS A VISION OF A MORE SUSTAINABLE RURAL FUTURE THAT ADDRESSES MULTIPLE DEMOGRAPHIC, CLIMATIC, TECHNOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL THREATS TO CONTEMPORARY RURAL LIFE?
RELEASING THE POTENTIAL OF YOUR RURAL ECONOMY
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN SCHOOLS OF GEOGRAPHY AND BUSINESS HAVE TEAMED UP WITH ROGER TURNER OF RURAL ENTERPRISE UK (NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY) TO LAUNCH A GUIDE FOR ECONOMIC POLICY-MAKERS TO ENSURE THAT RURAL AREAS ARE PROPERLY RECOGNISED WITHIN NEW LOCAL INDUSTRIAL STRATEGIES.

SALFAR WILL CARRY OUR CROP TRIALS IN A NUMBER OF EU COUNTRIES, INCLUDING HERE IN LINCOLNSHIRE, AS PART OF A PROJECT ASSESSING THE WIDER MARKET POTENTIAL FOR SALT-TOLERANT VARIETIES AND INNOVATIVE HALOPHYTIC CROPS.
THE IMPORTANCE OF BEES FOR THE NATIONS FOOD SECURITY IS WELL KNOWN. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEEKEEPERS, HOWEVER, RECEIVES LESS ATTENTION. THIS SURVEY SEEKS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP BEES AND THEIR MOTIVATIONS  ARE THEY JUST HOBBYISTS, ARE THEY ENVIRONMENTALISTS OR ARE THEY BUSINESS PEOPLE? WITH THIS KNOWLEDGE, POLICY DESIGNED TO SUPPORT BEE POPULATIONS CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY ENGAGE BEEKEEPERS LEADING TO BETTER IMPLEMENTATION.
MEMBERS OF RURAL VISIONS HAVE RECENTLY CARRIED OUT A STUDY HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACED BY FARMERS AND OTHER AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. THEIR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INCREASED STRESS AND POOR HEALTH CAN ARISE FROM COMBINATIONS OF FARM-LEVEL AND COMMUNITY FACTORS INTERACTING WITH ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES.
RURAL VISIONS RUNS A SERIES OF REGULAR INTERNAL RESEARCH SEMINARS, INCLUDING EVENTS DISCUSSING CURRENT RESEARCH WITHIN THE RURAL VISIONS GROUP AND SESSIONS OFFERING TIPS AND GUIDANCE TO THOSE WRITING RESEARCH PROPOSALS.
RURAL VISIONS AIMS TO SUPPORT PHD STUDENTS WORKING IN THE BROAD FIELD OF RURAL RESEARCH. STUDENTS APPLY TO A CHOSEN SCHOOL/DEPARTMENT WHICH WILL BE THEIR ACADEMIC HOME DURING THEIR STUDIES BUT PLEASE CONTACT GARY BOSWORTH AND REFER TO RURAL VISIONS IN YOUR APPLICATION IF YOU FEEL THAT YOUR RESEARCH IDEAS FALL WITHIN THE REMIT OF THIS GROUP.

WEATHER STATION | DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNA WEATHER STATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN
THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY AND LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH HAVE RECENTLY SET UP AN AUTOMATIC WEATHER STATION (AWS) ON THE ROOFTOP OF THE ISAAC NEWTON BUILDING. THIS IS A DAVIS VANTAGE PRO 2 MODEL, WHICH IS INDUSTRY STANDARD AND WIDELY USED WORLDWIDE.
WE ARE LOGGING DATA EVERY 5 MINUTES OF THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS: AIR TEMPERATURE (NEAREST 0.1 DEGREES CELSIUS), RELATIVE HUMIDITY (PERCENT), BAROMETRIC AIR PRESSURE (MILLIBARS), WIND SPEED (MILES PER HOUR) AND DIRECTION (DEGREES), PRECIPITATION (RAIN-+SNOW-FALL IN MILLIMETRES), AND SOLAR RADIATION (WATTS PER SQUARE METRE).
THE AIR TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY SENSORS ARE IN A WHITE LOUVERED PLASTIC RADIATION SHIELD TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE SUN AND RAIN, AND HAVE A SOLAR-POWERED FAN TO IMPROVE MEASUREMENT ACCURACY. THERE IS ALSO AN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT INTENSITY METER, AND WE PLAN TO ADD A SKY-VIEW CAMERA TO PROVIDE A RECORD OF CHANGES IN SKY CONDITIONS AND CLOUD COVER.
METEOROLOGICAL DATA, WHICH WE BEGAN LOGGING ON 21 DECEMBER 2018, ARE ARCHIVED IN PERPETUITY AND ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE IN THE UNIVERSITY FOR TEACHING OR RESEARCH PURPOSES. PLEASE CONTACT PROFESSOR EDWARD HANNAOR DR JOE HARWOODIF YOU WOULD LIKE ACCESS TO THE ARCHIVED DATA, CLEARLY STATING WHAT TIME PERIOD AND PARAMETERS YOU ARE INTERESTED IN RECEIVING AND A BRIEF PURPOSE OF YOUR PROJECT.
WITHIN THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY WE PLAN TO USE THE DATA IN A VARIETY OF STUDENT PROJECTS AND FOR MICROMETEOROLOGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH. EXAMPLE STUDIES MIGHT INCLUDE OF THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IN AND AROUND LINCOLN, AND SHORT-TERM METEOROLOGICAL VARIATIONS LINKED TO EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS. IT IS ALSO PLANNED TO SUBMIT MONTHLY SUMMARIES OF OUR WEATHER DATA TO THE CLIMATOLOGICAL OBSERVERS LINK NATIONAL NETWORK.

IN KEEPING WITH THE INTEGRATED THEMES OF OUR PROGRAMMES, STUDENTS HAVE EXPLORED HUMAN AND PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHIES RELATING TO URBAN INEQUALITIES AND GENTRIFICATION, GLACIAL ENVIRONMENTS, MINING, EXTRACTIVISM, AND GEOHERITAGE.
LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH | RESEARCH | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNTHE LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH (LCWPH) FOCUSES ON SOLVING THE MOST PRESSING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS AND WATER RESOURCES. THESE INCLUDE HYDROLOGICAL AND SEA-LEVEL IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, FLOOD-RELATED CONTAMINATION FROM METAL MINING AND PROCESSING, AND WATER-BORNE AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES AFFECTING HUMANS AND ANIMALS, AS WELL AS BEHAVIOURAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC ADAPTATION MECHANISMS TO MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS.
THE LINCOLN CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH (LCWPH) IS THE FIRST INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH CENTRE OF ITS KIND IN THE UK TO FOCUS ON SOLVING THE MOST PRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL ISSUES EMERGING FROM WATER-RELATED RISKS ON HUMAN AND ECOSYSTEM HEALTH IN AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS.
TO UNDERSTAND THESE COMPLEX SOCIO-ENVIRONMENTAL INTERACTIONS AND DEVELOP EFFECTIVE ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES, THE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH WITHIN THE LCWPH LINKS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES WITH HUMANITIES AND HUMAN HEALTH.
THE LCWPH USES THE EMERGING IDEA OF PLANETARY HEALTH (THE HEALTH OF HUMAN CIVILISATION AND THE STATE OF THE NATURAL SYSTEMS ON WHICH IT DEPENDS) AND INTEGRATING IT WITH RIVER, CATCHMENT, AND COASTAL SCIENCE IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS IMPORTANT CONCEPT OPERATIONAL FOR DELIVERING EVIDENCE-BASED WATER AND HEALTH INTERVENTIONS PROVIDING THE UNDERPINNING SCIENCE TO TACKLE A SERIES OF UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS.

HOW DOES OUR RURAL RESEARCH CONTRIBUTE TO THE UNIVERSITYS "CIVIC MISSION?
THIS WILL BE A CHANCE TO DISCUSS OUR RESEARCH IN TERMS OF ITS WIDER SOCIETAL IMPORTANCE. IF ANYONE HAS A RURAL IMPACT CASE STUDY UNDER DEVELOPMENT OR IS WORKING WITH RURAL RESEARCH USERS, THIS IS A CHANCE TO PRESENT YOUR WORK TO THE GROUP AND BUILD YOUR NETWORKS. THIS IS INTENDED AS A PRECURSOR TO A RURAL STAKEHOLDER EVENT LATER IN THE YEAR.
WITH SMALLER AND SPARSER POPULATIONS, AND WITH DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE MEANING OF RURALITY, DOES RURAL RESEARCH NEED TO BE FRAMED OR CONDUCTED DIFFERENTLY? PLEASE OFFER ANY EXAMPLES THAT YOU THINK DEMONSTRATE THE NEED FOR (OR NOT) ANY DISTINCTIVE APPROACHES. WE ARE WORKING ON A BOOK PROPOSAL AND WILL BE PUTTING OUT A CALL FOR CHAPTERS CONNECTED TO THIS SESSION.
OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM ADDRESSES THE FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DYNAMICS OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH COMPARED TO THE GLOBAL NORTH. KEY CHALLENGES IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH INCLUDE LACK OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS AND RESOURCE DEPLETION. BY COMPARISON, THE GLOBAL NORTH IS FACED WITH OVERCOMING THE LEGACY OF NEOLIBERALISM, INCLUDING THE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN OF WESTERN ECONOMIES ON LESS WEALTHY REGIONS. WHILE THE BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO ACHIEVING THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS VARY GEOGRAPHICALLY, THERE ARE ALSO COMMON DEEP CAUSES, INCLUDING THE COLONIAL ROOTS OF MODERN-DAY CHALLENGES. UNPACKING THESE CAUSES OF CAUSES IS A CENTRAL OBJECTIVE OF OUR RESEARCH GROUP, AND AN ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS ERADICATING INEQUALITIES BETWEEN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED NATIONS, AS WELL AS WITHIN REGIONS.

IN 2020 DR MOORE PUBLISHED A STUDY FOLLOWING HER DOCTORAL RESEARCH IN AUSTRALIA ABOUT THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN (MDB), EXAMINING THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT. THE STUDY CONSIDERED THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT DICTATE HOW WATER IS RECOVERED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES AT THE BASIN SCALE. THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT EFFORTS TO SECURE WATER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES LIKE THE ARTIFICIAL WATERING OF FLOOD-PLAINS WOULD FALL SHORT OF THE MINIMUM AMOUNTS REQUIRED TO ENSURE THE SURVIVAL OF ECOSYSTEMS IN THE MDB. IN 2023, PROFESSOR JAMIE PITTOCK AT ANU SUGGESTS THAT AS DR MOORE AND COLLEAGUES EXPECTED, THESE EFFORTS HAVE FAILED TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF THE MDB PLAN, INCLUDING SECURING WATER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THE ANALYSIS PRESENTED BY MOORE AND COLLEAGUES (BELOW) COULD HELP PREDICT POLICY FAILURES BEFORE THEY HAPPEN IN REGIONS WITH SIMILAR WATER ENTITLEMENT ARRANGEMENTS (E.G., CHILE).
DR MOORES RESEARCH IN THE MURRAY-DARLING BASIN OF AUSTRALIA EXAMINES THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND INCREASING FINANCIAL CONSTRAINT. HER STUDIES CONSIDER THE SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS THAT FACILITATE OR IMPEDE LOCAL-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOUR, AS WELL AS THE INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT DICTATE HOW WATER IS RECOVERED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES AT THE BASIN SCALE.

S HOSPITAL, MELBOURNE. THE SEMINAR IS A BIG PICTURE VIEW OF HOW CHILDREN ARE FARING IN A CHANGING WORLD AND IS STRUCTURED AROUND A SERIES OF KEY QUESTIONS: WHAT JUST HAPPENED (TO OUR PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL WORLDS)? WHAT IMPACT HAVE THESE CHANGES HAD? WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES NEED? WHAT HAVE WE TRIED? HOW EFFECTIVE HAVE THESE EFFORTS BEEN? WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO NOW? ", 'THE SECOND SEMINAR IS DELIVERED BY DR ANDREW KYTHREOTIS, A SENIOR LECTURER IN POLITICAL AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHY AT THE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY, UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. THIS SEMINAR USES INTERVIEW DATA WITH EXPERTS WORKING ON CLIMATE EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS RESEARCH ACROSS THE UK, AND WILL CRITICALLY DISCUSS FOUR KEY THEMES THAT HAVE UNDERPINNED AND CATALYSED THE CHANGING GEOGRAPHIES AND THE CIVIL-STATE RELATIONSHIP WITHIN THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY AND WHAT THIS MAY MEAN FOR FUTURE GLOBAL CLIMATE GOVERNANCE UNDER THE UNFCCC CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES (COP). THREE KEY POINTS RELATED TO THE GEOGRAPHIES OF CLIMATE WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED POLICYMAKING: NATIONAL CLIMATE POLICY SCALAR DISSONANCE, GLOBAL COLLECTIVE POLICY DISSONANCE, THE COVID CATALYST.
THE THIRD SEMINAR IS DELIVERED BY DR JEN MANNE-GOEHLER, A PHYSICIAN-SCIENTIST AND FACULTY MEMBER AT THE BRIGHAM AND WOMENS HOSPITAL, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL. THIS SEMINAR TAKES A BROAD VIEW OF THE EVOLVING EPIDEMIC OF METABOLIC DISEASE, INCLUDING BOTH OBESITY AND DIABETES. IT EXPLORES THE SOCIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND HEALTH SYSTEMS CHALLENGES FOR PATIENTS WITH OR AT HIGH RISK OF METABOLIC DISEASE AND THE TRANSITIONS THAT HAVE LED THIS TO BECOME A TRULY GLOBAL EPIDEMIC. A SECOND AREA EXPLORED IS HOW THE GLOBAL HEALTH COMMUNITY HAS NOT ONLY COME TO RECOGNISE THE METABOLIC DISEASE AS A TOP HEALTH PRIORITY BUT ALSO EXPLORE THE WAYS IN WHICH THIS COMMUNITY IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THIS ESSENTIAL HEALTH CHALLENGE.
THE FOURTH SEMINAR IS DELIVERED BY DR JULIAN CLIFTON. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 12 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE WHO ARE NOT RECOGNISED AS NATIONALS BY ANY STATE. STATELESSNESS AFFECTS PEOPLES HUMAN RIGHTS, WITH STATELESS PEOPLE UNABLE TO ACCESS EDUCATION, HEALTH AND WORK OPPORTUNITIES. MANY STATELESS PEOPLE ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO PERSECUTION, TRAFFICKING AND IMPRISONMENT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DRIVERS OF STATELESSNESS WHICH ARE OFTEN REINFORCED, WHETHER BY ACCIDENT OR DESIGN, BY GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN OTHER AREAS. THIS PRESENTATION WILL EXPLORE THE CONTEXT AND OUTCOMES OF STATELESSNESS IN MARITIME SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHERE STATE POLICIES RELATING TO TOURISM AND CONSERVATION UNDERMINE ATTEMPTS TO REDUCE STATELESSNESS.

COASTAL WETLANDS PROVIDE IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BOTH TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. USING FIELD DATA AND NUMERICAL MODELLING, THE RESTORATION OF PREVIOUSLY LOST COASTAL WETLANDS IS STUDIED AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE COASTAL MANAGEMENT PLANS TO EFFECTIVELY HARVEST THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY COASTAL WETLANDS. THIS RESEARCH HELPS TO INFORM LOCAL AND NATIONAL DECISION MAKERS TO IMPLEMENT ECOSYSTEM-BASED APPROACHES TO COASTAL ADAPTATION WITH CO-BENEFITS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THE WIDER SOCIETY.
WE WORK WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS, SUCH AS THE ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, NATURAL ENGLAND AND THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF BIRDS TO QUANTIFY THE COASTAL PROTECTION FUNCTION OF RESTORED SALTMARSHES. NEAR BOSTON, LINCOLNSHIRE, FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE PRESSURE SENSORS TO MEASURE WAVE HEIGHTS AND WATER LEVELS WITHIN THE MANAGED REALIGNMENT (A TECHNIQUE TO RESTORE SALTMARSHES BY RE-INTRODUCING THE TIDAL REGIME INTO PREVIOUSLY RECLAIMED LAND) FREISTON SHORE. THIS PROVIDES NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE REDUCTION OF WAVE HEIGHTS AND WATER LEVELS DURING STORM SURGES.
THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE DECISION-MAKERS WITH THE NECESSARY SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO DEVELOP LONG-TERM STRATEGIES FOR COASTAL ADAPTION, AND IT WILL FURTHER OUR KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO BUILD EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE COASTAL SEA DEFENCES IN THE UK AND ELSEWHERE.

MARK MACKLINIS LEADING INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN BOTH THE DESERT NILE, SUDAN, (IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BRITISH MUSEUM, THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER AND YALE UNIVERSITY) AND IN ARAL SEA BASIN, KAZAKHSTAN, (IN COLLABORATION WITH UV UNIVERSITY AMSTERDAM, UCL, UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD, AND JSC INSTITUTE OF GEOGRAPHY AND WATER SAFETY, ALMATY, REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN) INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF HOLOCENE AND HISTORICAL CLIMATE CHANGE ON FLOODWATER FARMING IN DRYLAND RIVERS. THIS FORMS PART OF LONGER-TERM AND WORLDWIDE STUDY OF PEOPLE RIVER ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS (E.G. MACKLIN AND LEWIN (2015) QSR, 114, 228-244; TOONEN, MACKLIN ET AL.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BOTH THE GEOMORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF COASTAL WETLANDS, SUCH AS SALTMARSHES AND MANGROVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES OF VALUABLE ECOSYSTEMS IN THE DECADES TO COME. FIELD OBSERVATIONS AND MODELLING ARE USED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY GLOBAL SEA LEVEL RISE AND CHANGES IN GLOBAL STORM CLIMATES, ON COASTAL WETLANDS.
WE WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS, SUCH AS NATURAL ENGLAND AND THE LINCOLNSHIRE WILDLIFE TRUST TO ESTIMATE HOW DUNE ECOSYSTEMS AND COASTAL WETLANDS IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND THE UK RESPOND TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEA LEVEL RISE. IN THE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVES GIBRALTAR POINT AND SALTFLEETBY - THEDDLETHORPE DUNES, FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES, GIS MODELLING AND FIELD DATA COLLECTION TO RECONSTRUCT THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL/ECOLOGICAL EVOLUTION AND HYDROLOGICAL DRIVERS TO ESTIMATE THEIR PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT.
WITH THE LOCAL-SCALE PROCESS KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THESE STUDIES WE WORK TO UPSCALE THE ASSESSMENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS TO CONTINENTAL AND GLOBAL SCALES. WITH OUR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATORS, WE DEVELOP MODELLING TOOLS TO HELP NATIONAL AND SUPRA-NATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS TO MANAGE THEIR COASTLINES MORE SUSTAINABLY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
DR. KRISTEN BECKANDDR. MATTHEW HANNAFORD EXPLORE PAST CLIMATIC CHANGE USING RECONSTRUCTIONS FROM NATURAL ARCHIVES AND DOCUMENTARY RECORDS. DR. BECK INVESTIGATES LATE QUATERNARY CLIMATE PATTERNS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. DR. HANNAFORD USES DOCUMENTARY SOURCES TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF PAST CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND ITS IMPACTS ON SOCIETY, AS WELL AS SOCIAL RESPONSES AND ADAPTATION. OUR RESEARCH ALSO USES THIS HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE TO INFORM PRESENT-DAY CHALLENGES.
MORE RELIABLE PREDICTIONS OF SEASONAL WEATHER WOULD BE HUGELY BENEFICIAL TO SOCIETY. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN SOME SKILL FOR WINTER, SO FAR THERE IS LITTLE PREDICTABILITY FOR SUMMER IN WEATHER FORECASTING MODELS. NOW A MAJOR NEW NERC-FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECT LED BYPROF. EDWARD HANNA AIMS TO TRANSFORM THE WAY FORECASTERS MODEL THE EFFECTS OF THE JET STREAM AND OTHER ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATIONS ON THE WEATHER OF BRITAIN AND ITS NEAR NEIGHBOURS. BETTER SEASONAL WEATHER FORECASTS ARE VALUABLE NOT JUST FOR HOLIDAYMAKERS BUT ALSO PUBLIC POLICY, LIKE AUTHORITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FLOOD PREVENTION, AND PARTICULARLY THE FOOD AND FARMING INDUSTRY - WHERE A POOR HARVEST CAUSED BY EXTREME WEATHER CAN WRECK LIVELIHOODS AND PUSH PRICES UP FOR CONSUMERS.
THE NORTH ATLANTIC JET STREAM IS A GIANT CURRENT OF AIR WHICH STRONGLY INFLUENCES SEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN NORTHWEST EUROPE. ITS STRENGTH AND LOCATION CAN DRIVE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS IN THE UK AND NEARBY COUNTRIES, LIKE FLASH FLOODS, FREEZING WINTERS OR SCORCHING SUMMER DAYS. UNTIL RECENTLY IT WAS THOUGHT THE JET STREAM WAS TOO UNPREDICTABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MODEL IN SEASONAL WEATHER FORECASTS. ITS BEHAVIOUR IS BELIEVED TO BE DRIVEN BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, RANGING FROM SEA ICE CHANGES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN SOLAR RADIATION. OTHER ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA - LIKE THE INFAMOUS EL NIO EFFECT AND EVEN VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS - ARE THOUGHT TO SHAPE ITS CHARACTERISTICS FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. MODERN PHYSICS-BASED DYNAMICAL SEASONAL FORECASTING SYSTEMS RUN ON GIANT SUPERCOMPUTERS HAVE ENHANCED FORECASTING ACCURACY FOR WINTER MONTHS BUT SEASONAL FORECASTS OF THE SUMMER CLIMATE IN THE UK AND NORTHWEST EUROPE HAVE REMAINED DEFIANTLY DIFFICULT TO MODEL CONSISTENTLY.
A TEAM OF CLIMATE SCIENTISTS LED BYPROF. HANNA HAS BEEN AWARDED UK GOVERNMENT RESEARCH FUNDING TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE PROBABILISTIC STATISTICAL FORECASTS OF THE STATE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC JET STREAM. THE RESEARCHERS PLAN TO COMBINE A COMPLEX STATISTICAL METHOD KNOWN AS NARMAX AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE THE UK AND NORTHWEST EUROPE WITH IMPROVED SEASONAL REGIONAL FORECASTS - INCLUDING MORE ACCURATE SUMMER CLIMATE PREDICTIONS. PILOT STUDIES USING THE TECHNIQUE, PUBLISHED IN A PAPER IN THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY IN 2019, HAVE ALREADY SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS.
THE THREE-YEAR RESEARCH PROJECT NORTHWEST EUROPEAN SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION FROM COMPLEX SYSTEMS MODELLING HAS BEEN ALLOCATED 650,000 UK GOVERNMENT GRANT FUNDING FROM THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL (NERC), PART OF UK RESEARCH AND INNOVATION (UKRI).

THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET AND GLOBAL WARMING | LINCOLN CLIMATE RESEARCH GROUP | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNTHE GREENLAND ICE SHEET AND GLOBAL WARMING
THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET IS A GIANT RESERVOIR OF ICE THAT CONTAINS ENOUGH WATER TO ULTIMATELY RAISE GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL BY SEVEN METERS.PROF. EDWARD HANNA RECENTLY LED AN INTERNATIONAL TEAM INVOLVING BELGIAN, DANISH, SWISS AND AMERICAN GLACIOLOGISTS AND CLIMATOLOGISTS THAT PUBLISHED WORK (INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY, 2020) WHICH QUANTIFIES THE RESPONSE OF THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET TO CLIMATE CHANGE, BASED ON WEATHER STATION DATA AND COMPUTER MODELLING. HE IS ALSO INVOLVED IN FURTHER WORK THAT IS CURRENTLY EXTENDING GREENLAND ICE SHEET SURFACE MASS BALANCE (MONTHLY SNOW ACCUMULATION MINUS SURFACE MELTWATER RUNOFF) RECORDS BACK TO 1806. THIS BODY OF WORK HELPS INFORM ESTIMATES OF CLIMATE-CRYOSPHERE SENSITIVITY AND GLOBAL SEA-LEVEL RISE, AND OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS HAVE BEEN USED BY THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE.
OUR RECENT PUBLISHED RESULTS PROVIDE AN UPDATED ANALYSIS OF GREENLAND SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE DATA FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES THROUGH TO 2019, FOCUSING MAINLY ON COASTAL WEATHER STATIONS BUT ALSO ANALYSING RECORDS FROM RELATIVELY LONG-RUNNING SITES ON THE INTERIOR PLATEAU OF THE ICE SHEET. WE FOUND THAT GREENLAND COASTAL REGIONS WARMED SIGNIFICANTLY BY ABOUT 4.4 DEGREES CELSIUS IN WINTER AND 1.7DEGC IN SUMMER FROM 1991 TO 2019. OUR WORK, COMBINING GREENLAND TEMPERATURE DATA WITH COMPUTER MODEL OUTPUT OF ICE-SHEETMASSBALANCE FOR 1972 TO 2018, SHOWS THAT EACH 1DEGC OF SUMMER WARMING CORRESPONDS TO SOME 91 BILLION TONS PER YEAR OF SURFACE MASS LOSS AND 116 BILLION TONS PER YEAR OF TOTAL MASS LOSS FROM THE ICE SHEET. PROF. HANNASRESEARCH TEAM USED SOME OF THE LATEST AVAILABLE GLOBAL AND REGIONAL CLIMATE MODELLING TOOLS TO ESTIMATE THAT, UNDER SUSTAINED STRONG GLOBAL WARMING, GREENLAND IS LIKELY TO WARM 4.0 TO 6.6 DEGC BY THE YEAR 2100. THESE RECENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE GREENLAND WARMINGS ARE CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE CHANGES FOR EQUIVALENT TIME PERIODS, REFLECTING A HIGH SENSITIVITY OF THE POLAR REGIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE THEN USED THE RELATION WE DERIVED BETWEEN RECENT CHANGES IN GREENLAND SUMMER TEMPERATURE AND SURFACEMASS BALANCETO CALCULATE A 10 TO 12.5 CENTIMETRES INCREASE IN GLOBAL SEA LEVELBY 2100 ARISING FROM INCREASED GREENLAND ICE MELT AND SURFACE MASS LOSS.
THE ARCTIC IS WARMING FASTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE ON EARTH, A PHENOMENON KNOWN AS ARCTIC AMPLIFICATION. THIS IS THOUGHT TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON MID-LATITUDE WEATHER VIA CHANGES IN THE JET STREAM AND POLAR VORTEX.SUPPORTED BY WORLD CLIMATE RESEARCH PROGRAMME CLIMATE AND CRYOSPHERE PROJECT AND INTERNATIONAL ARCTIC SCIENCE COMMITTEE FUNDING,PROF. EDWARD HANNAIS ACTIVELY ENGAGED WITH INTERNATIONAL RESEARCHERS, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE NATURE OF THESE LINKS AND ANY IMPACT ON EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND TO UNDERSTAND THEIR SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS. FROM 2015 TO 2021 OUR ARCTIC-MIDLATITUDE LINKAGES GROUP HAS PUBLISHED A SERIES OF HIGH-PROFILE REVIEW PAPERS ON THIS TOPIC. FURTHER WORK CONDUCTED BYPROF. HANNA HAS SHOWN THAT THE NORTH ATLANTIC JET STREAM HAS BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VARIABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN WINTER (GRAPH BELOW) AND THIS IS LINKED TO MORE SEVERE WEATHER EXPERIENCED IN THE UK IN THE LAST 10-15 YEARS. ALSOPROF. HANNA CARRIES OUT FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH INTO BLOCKING HIGH AIR PRESSURE CHANGES OVER GREENLAND AND THEIR LINKS WITH GLOBAL AND ARCTIC WARMING, THE NORTH ATLANTIC JET STREAM AND NORTHWEST EUROPEAN EXTREME WEATHER. HE HAS DEVELOPED GREENLAND BLOCKING INDEX DATASETS THAT ARE ARCHIVED BY THE NATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION (THE US WEATHER AND CLIMATE SERVICE) AND WIDELY USED INTERNATIONALLY.PROF. HANNA IS ALSO A REGULAR CO-AUTHOR OF NOAAS ANNUAL ARCTIC REPORT CARD, WHICH REVIEWS THE LATEST CLIMATE CHANGES AND IMPACTS IN THE ARCTIC.
CCRG SUPPORTS A RANGE OF POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH PROJECTS ON THE MASTERS AND PHD LEVEL.
CCRG ACADEMICS ARE ABLE TO SUPERVISE A WIDER RANGE OF TOPICS WITH THE CATCHMENTS AND COAST RESEARCH THEME. FOR A LIST OF POSSIBLE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT OUR CCRG ACADEMICS ARE HAPPY TO SUPERVISE, PLEASE VISIT OUR WORK WITH US SECTION.
CCRG STUDIES EXISTING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS IN RIVERS, CATCHMENTS AND COASTAL ZONES, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES LIKE NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT (IN FLUVIAL ENVIRONMENTS), MANAGED REALIGNMENTS (IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS) AND ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION/REWILDING INCLUDING CARBON AND BIODIVERSITY CREDITS SCHEMES. A WIDE VARIETY OF APPROACHES HAVE BEEN APPLIED TO QUANTIFY NBS IMPACT, INCLUDING FIELD MEASUREMENTS, UAV SURVEYS, AND NUMERICAL MODELLING ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING NBS THEMES:
CCRG WORKS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS RELATED TO COASTAL GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO THE RESPONSE OF THE FINE-SEDIMENT COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS, SUCH AS TIDAL MUDFLAT, SALTMARSH, MANGROVES AND SEAGRASS MEADOWS, TO NATURAL, CLIMATIC AND HUMAN PRESSURES ARISING FROM GLOBAL CHANGE
CCRG MEMBERS ARE WORKING ON THE EUROPEAN UNION FUNDED REST-COAST PROJECT WITH 37 OTHER PARTNERS. THE OVERARCHING PROJECT AIM IS TO INVESTIGATE TO WHAT EXTENT CAN UPSCALED COASTAL RESTORATION PROVIDE LOW CARBON ADAPTION TO RISING SEA LEVELS AND CAN IT REDUCE RISKS AND PRODUCE BIODIVERSITY GAINS FOR VULNERABLE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS LIKE WETLANDS AND SEAGRASS BEDS? THE MEMBERS OF CCRG ARE HELPING ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON MODELLING CURRENT GLOBAL INTERTIDAL WETLAND EXTENT AND PROJECTIONS FOR THE EXTENT IN THE FUTURE UNDER GROWING SOCIAL AND CLIMATIC PRESSURES.
CCRG MEMBER ARE WORKING WITH LOCAL PARTNER TO MONITOR THE LONG-TERM DEVELOPMENT OF SALTMARSHES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE COASTS. SURFACE-ELEVATION TABLE, A MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE THAT ALLOW FOR THE LONG-TERM MONITORING OF SURFACE ELEVATION CHANGES ARE MAINTAINED AND MONITORED IN THE MARSHES OF THE GIBRALTAR POINT AND THE SALTFLEETBY-THEDDLETHORPHE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVES. THE DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF THIS EFFORT WILL HELP CCRG TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF LONG-TERM SEA LEVEL RISE AND EXTREME STORM EVENTS ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF THESE VALUABLE SALTMARSHES.
MEMBERS OF THE CCRG ARE WORKING ON COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS ALONG THE LINCOLNSHIRE COASTAL (E.G. GIBRALTAR POINT NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE AND SALTFLEETBY-THEDDLETHORPE NATIONAL NATURE RESERVE) IN THE UK TO STUDY THE PAST HABITAT DEVELOPMENTS AND ASSOCIATED CHANGES TO HABITAT DIVERSITY AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION OVER TIME. THIS RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY AIMS TO PROVIDE AN EVIDENCE BASE FOR SUSTAINABLY MANAGE THESE VALUABLE COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS.
MEMBERS OF THE CCRG, INCLUDING OUR PHD STUDENT GERTUDA ZIENIUTE, ARE WORKING AT THE FREISTON SHORE MANAGED REALIGNMENT IN THE WASH, UK INVESTIGATING GEOCHEMICAL CHANGES AND MICROPLASTICS ACCUMULATION OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS.
CATCHMENTS AND COASTS RESEARCH GROUP | RESEARCH | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNCATCHMENT AND COASTAL PROCESSES IN THE LIGHT OF GLOBAL CHANGE
CATCHMENT AND COASTAL PROCESSES AFFECT BILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE IN THE MOST DIVERSE WAYS, E.G. BY PROVIDING WATER RESOURCES AND NATURAL HABITAT, BY PROVIDING SUITABLE GROUNDS FOR EXTENSIVE AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY, HUMAN SETTLEMENTS AND RECREATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS, AS A HOST OF ABUNDANT BIODIVERSITY, AND AS A SOURCE OF THREATS FROM NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS FLOODING OR EROSION. WITH INCREASING IMPACTS ARISING FROM HUMAN ACTIVITIES IN RIVER CATCHMENTS, COASTAL SYSTEMS AND ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE, THESE THREATS TO NATURAL HABITATS, BIODIVERSITY AND RESIDENT COMMUNITIES ARE INCREASINGLY EXACERBATED. TO GAIN A MORE DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF THESE IMPACTS, CCRG CONSIDERS CATCHMENTS AND COASTS AS INTERCONNECTED AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, WHICH ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE OUTCOMES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HUMAN IMPACTS (E.G. LAND-USE CHANGE) FOR RIVERS, CATCHMENTS AND COASTAL ZONES.
HARD ENGINEERING (I.E. THE CONSTRUCTION OF HARD FLOOD PROTECTION INFRASTRUCTURE) HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN APPLIED TO ADDRESS FLOODING AND EROSION RELATED RISKS IN RIVER CATCHMENTS AND COASTAL SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AS WELL AS CATCHMENT AND COASTAL MANAGERS ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZING THE URGENT NEED FOR UTILIZING NATURAL DYNAMICS TO REDUCE RISKS FROM FLOODING AND EROSION, THEREBY ENHANCING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF FLOOD AND EROSION MITIGATION STRATEGIES, RESTORING NATURAL HABITATS, INCREASING BIODIVERSITY, ENHANCING GROUNDWATER RECHARGE, AND CREATING ADDITIONAL SINKS FOR ATMOSPHERIC CARBON TO SUPPORT NATIONAL NET-ZERO CARBON TARGET. HOWEVER, TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND EFFECTIVE NBS, IT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO WORK WITH (RURAL) COMMUNITIES TO ADEQUATELY QUANTIFY ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF NBS AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NBS. IN CCRG, WE AIM TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN CATCHMENT AND COASTAL MANAGERS WANTING TO IMPLEMENT NBS AND RESIDENT COMMUNITIES FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE SCHEMES.
S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS, NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.", 'OUR RESEARCH
CATCHMENT PROCESSES INCLUDE THE INTERCONNECTION OF THE TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT. OUR CATCHMENTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN CLIMATE, LAND-USE, AND NATURAL PROCESSES. CHANGES IN OUR CATCHMENTS CAN IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR FLUVIAL SYSTEMS AND COASTAL LANDSCAPES. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE AND HUMAN ACTIVITY ON TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. 
RIVER SYSTEMS DRAIN WATER AND CARRY SEDIMENTS FROM THE CATCHMENTS TO COASTAL AREAS, AND CONCENTRATE A WIDE RANGE OF RESOURCES AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE FUNDAMENTAL PROCESSES THAT DETERMINE RIVER FORMS AND BEHAVIOURS, CHANGES DUE TO DIRECT HUMAN DISTURBANCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE, AND LIES AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN GEOMORPHOLOGY, ECOLOGY AND HYDROLOGY.  
COASTAL LANDSCAPES ARE FORMED BY THE POWER OF WAVES AND TIDES, AND DEPEND ON SEDIMENTS DELIVERED BY RIVERS. GLOBAL CHANGE, INCLUDING SEA-LEVEL RISE AND CHANGING STORM PATTERNS, SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFIES THESE DRIVERS, AND OUR RESEARCH AIMS TO ESTIMATE FUTURE COASTAL LANDSCAPES THROUGH MODELLING AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF PAST COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS.  
NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS UTILISE NATURAL ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO ADDRESS EXISTING SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. THEY ARE GENERALLY SUSTAINABLE AND LOW COST, AND PROVIDE WIDE BENEFITS; HOWEVER, DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE ACTUAL VALUES. OUR RESEARCH AIMS TO ASSESS THOSE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THROUGH FIELD SURVEYS AND NUMERICAL MODELLING WORKS. 
CCRG IS INVOLVED IN A WIDE RANGE OF EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY FUNDED RESEARCH PROJECTS. THESE COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROJECTS DELIVER INCLUSIVE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TO ADDRESS THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CHALLENGES AT HAND AND ACTIVELY INVOLVE RESEARCHERS OF ALL CAREER STAGES. 
TO OPTIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OUR RESEARCH, CCRG MEMBERS ACTIVELY PUBLISH THEIR RESEARCH IN SPECIALIST AND HIGH-IMPACT SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS, AS WELL AS IN OUTLETS DESIGNED FOR WIDER/PUBLIC AUDIENCES. 
FOSTERING PGR RESEARCHERS IN THE FIELD OF CATCHMENT AND COASTAL RESEARCH IS ONE OF CCRGS KEY STRATEGIC AIMS. OUR PGR STUDENTS STUDY A WIDER RANGE OF DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECTS, WHICH ARE OFTEN EMBEDDED IN OUR BROADER RESEARCH PROJECTS. 
CCRG MEMBERS INVOLVE JUNIOR TO SENIOR ACADEMICS, PGR RESEARCHERS, PROFESSIONAL STAFF, AND AN ADVISORY BOARD FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AND BEYOND. CCRG MEMBERS COVER A RANGE OF SUBJECT EXPERTISE TO FOSTER INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION. 
THE CCRG INVESTIGATES GLOBAL ISSUES, SUCH AS CLIMATE CHANGE, HUMAN ACTIVITY, LAND-USE, AND FIRE, AND THE IMPLICATIONS TO CATCHMENT PROCESSES INCLUDING CHANGES IN VEGETATION, SOIL DYNAMICS, WATER RESOURCES, AND ECOSYSTEM HEALTH.
FIRE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT
DR BECK AND COLLEAGUES ARE INTERESTED IN HOW FIRE IS RELATED TO LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW FIRE IMPACTS OUR CATCHMENTS, CARBON STABILITY, AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS. THEIR WORK STRETCHES FROM AUSTRALIA TO THE UK.DR BECK IS INVESTIGATING HOW TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS ARE IMPACTED BY CLIMATE IN TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA.
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS ARE KEY TO CATCHMENT PROCESSES. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TERRESTRIAL-AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM INTERACTIONS ARE ALTERED OVER TIME AND BY EXTERNAL FORCES SUCH AS CLIMATE AND PEOPLE.
LAND USE AND LAND USE CHANGE IN RIVER CATCHMENTS ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS FOR CHANGE BOTH CATCHMENT AND COASTAL PROCESSES. DEFORESTATION OR REFORESTATION OF THE RIVER CATCHMENTS, FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF RIVERS AND COASTAL LANDFORMS SUCH AS ESTUARIES AND DELTAS. INCREASINGLY, CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE RIVERINE HABITAT QUALITY AND REDUCE FLUVIAL FLOOD RISK.
AS PART OF HER PHD RESEARCH, MIYO YOSHIAKI MODELS HOW LAND USE CHANGES AND COMMON CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES IMPACT ON THE DELIVERY OF FLUVIAL SEDIMENT INTO ESTUARIES AND HOW THEY IMPACT ON LONG-TERM ESTUARINE FLOOD RISKS.
MANAGING RIVER CATCHMENTS TO EITHER REDUCE FLUVIAL FLOOD RISKS, ENHANCE THE VALUE OF NATURAL HABITATS OR IMPROVE WATER QUALITY FREQUENTLY INVOLVES MODIFYING THE FUNCTION AND USE OF AGRICULTURAL SOILS AND UNDERSTANDING HOW AGRICULTURAL SOILS INTERACT WITH FLUVIAL AND COASTAL SYSTEMS.
CCRG COLLABORATES WITH THE UOL SOILS RESEARCH GROUP TO DEVELOP AND IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING THESE PROCESSES, INTERACTIONS AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS.
CATCHMENTS DELIVER WATER BUT ALSO SEDIMENTS TO THE RIVER NETWORK, AND THIS DETERMINES FLUVIAL PROCESSES. THE MAGNITUDE, TIMING AND TYPE OF SEDIMENTS DELIVERED TO RIVERS DEPEND ON THE LOCATION, EXTENT, TYPE AND DEGREE OF CONNECTIVITY OF SEDIMENT SOURCES AT THE SCALE OF CATCHMENT, AND ON THEIR CHANGES OVER TIME DUE TO THE OCCURRENCE OF NATURAL OR ANTHROPOGENIC DISTURBANCES. DR. LUCA MAO INVESTIGATES THESE PROCESSES IN ANDEAN AND ALPINE HIGH GRADIENT STREAMS USING A RANGE OF METHODS RANGING FROM REMOTE SENSING, THE USE OF DRONES TO SURVEY SEDIMENT SOURCES AREAS, AND THE MONITORING OF SEDIMENT TRANSPORT IN RIVERS.

RIVER SYSTEMS ACROSS THE GLOBAL HAVE LONG BEEN INHERENTLY RELATED TO HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH MOST CIVILIZATIONS FORMED AND THRIVED ALONG RIVERS, THEY CAN REPRESENT A SOURCE OF RISKS DURING FLOODS, AND SUFFER FROM ANTHROPOGENIC PRESSURES AND GLOBAL CHANGE.
SEDIMENT TRANSPORT PROCESSES AT THE SCALE OF GRAINS
THE ROLE OF VEGETATION AND LARGE WOOD IN RIVER PROCESSES
THE GROUP FOCUSES ON IDENTIFYING AND QUANTIFYING THE ROLE OF VEGETATION AND LARGE WOOD IN DETERMINING THE SHAPE AND MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES OR GRAVEL-BED RIVERS. PAST INVESTIGATIONS USED FLUME EXPERIMENTS TO OBSERVE CHANNEL CHANGES CAUSED BY VEGETATION ENCROACHING ON SAND-BEDDED RIVERS, AND ALSO FOCUSED ON QUANTIFYING THE ROLE OF LAND USE CHANGE IN THE DELIVERY OF LARGE WOOD TO ANDEAN HEADWATER STREAMS. CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT (CLEARCUT VS. THREE HINGING VS. NO INTERVENTIONS) ON ROUGHNESS IN LOW-GRADIENT RIVERS.
THE GROUP FOCUSES ON ASSESSING THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT HUMAN DISTURBANCES ON RIVER SYSTEMS. DR. LUCA MAO FOCUSES ESPECIALLY ON THE ROLE OF DAMS AND HYDROPOWER PLANTS OPERATIONS ON SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CHANNEL CHANGES, AND ON THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON GRAVEL MINING IN LARGE GRAVEL-BED RIVERS IN CHILE.
TUFA GROWTH AND THE GEOMETRY OF TUFA BARRAGES IN STREAMS
TUFA IS THE SOLID PRECIPITATION OF CALCIUM CARBONATE IN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS. UNDER CERTAIN PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF WATER AND LOCAL GEOMORPHOLOGICAL SETTING, TUFA CAN GROW A FEW MM PER YEAR, AND CAN CREATE STAIRCASE-LIKE SEQUENCES OF BARRAGES THAT DETERMINE THE MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF STREAMS. MSC STUDENT ANTONIA FOLEY MONITORS THE GROWTH OF TUFA IN A STREAM OF LINCOLNSHIRE AND INVESTIGATES THE GEOMETRY OF TUFA BARRAGES. 
CCRG IS WORKING WITH NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH TEAMS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF HUMAN IMPACTS, CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL DRIVERS ON CATCHMENT COASTAL WATER RESOURCES AND HELPS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR THE SUSTAINABLE USE OF RIVER, SURFACE AND GROUNDWATER RESOURCES. RESEARCH FOCI WITHIN THE THEME INCLUDE:
WILDFIRES ARE THE FUTURE THREAT TO FRESHWATER QUALITY GLOBALLY. RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE CCRG SUGGESTS WILDFIRES NOT ONLY BURN BIOMASS AND SOILS LAYERS WHICH ERODE INTO NEARBY WATERBODIES AND ALTER FRESHWATER CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS PH, TURBIDITY, ORGANIC AND BASE CATION CONTENT. THESE FIRES ALSO ALTER VEGETATION COMPOSITION AND IN TURN THE UNDERLYING SOIL ORGANIC COMPOSITION WHICH CAUSES SHIFTS IN AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM SPECIES COMPOSITION, CHANGE IN NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, AND CAN REDUCE RESILIENCE TO DISTURBANCE IN FRESHWATER SYSTEMS.
WATER QUALITY IS CENTRAL TO BOTH HUMANITYS ABILITY TO UTILISE WATER AS A RESOURCE AND THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IT CAN SUPPORT. IN THE CCRG WE RESEARCH THE QUALITY OF BOTH GROUND AND SURFACE WATER SYSTEMS AND HOW THESE WILL ALTER WITH HUMAN ACTION. WE HAVE A RANGE OF PROJECTS FOCUSING ON THE WATER QUALITY OF FENLAND CATCHMENTS INCLUDING THE RISK OF SALINIZATION OF GROUNDWATER, THE TRANSPORTATION OF MICROPLASTICS IN FENLAND RIVERS AND PHOSPHORUS DRIVEN EUTROPHICATION RISKS TO FENLAND RIVERS. BEYOND THIS OUR TEAM HAVE WORKED INTERNATIONALLY INCLUDING COLLABORATING WITH OTHER UNIVERSITIES ON CIRCUM-HIMALAYAN CATCHMENTS (E.G., GANGA, MEKONG ETC.).
SOIL IS BOTH A GATEWAY FOR WATER TO ENTER CATCHMENTS AND, IN MANAGED SYSTEMS, A KEY UTILISER OF CATCHMENT WATER VIA IRRIGATION. THE CCRG CONDUCTS APPLIED RESEARCH IN AGRICULTURE AND LAND MANAGEMENT, WITH PROJECTS ON IRRIGATION, DRAINAGE AND AGRICULTURAL WATER RESOURCES. CURRENT WORK FOCUSSES ON BRACKISH WATER RESOURCES IN COASTAL AGRICULTURE, AND THE IMPACTS OF SALINE IRRIGATION ON SOIL HEALTH.
PEATLANDS ARE KEY CARBON STORES AND UNIQUE HABITS AND LINCOLNSHIRE IS RICH IN THESE RESOURCES. THE CCRG WORKS WITH LAND MANAGERS AND TRUSTS TO DELIVER IMPACTFUL RESEARCH TO SUPPORT THE RESTORATION OF LOWLAND PEATLANDS AS WELL AS DETAILED CHEMICAL ANALYSIS TO UNDERSTAND CARBON STORAGE PROCESSES IN THESE SYSTEMS.
IN THE SECOND YEAR, ALL UNDERGRADUATE GEOGRAPHY STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE AN OPTIONAL MODULE TO UNDERTAKE A WORK PLACEMENT FOR ONE DAY A WEEK FOR TEN WEEKS WITH A LOCAL ORGANISATION. THE WORK PLACEMENT MODULE PROVIDES STUDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR PROFESSIONAL SKILLS BY SPENDING TIME WITH AN EMPLOYER.
STUDENTS SPEND A MINIMUM OF 70 HOURS WORKING UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE EMPLOYER GIVING THEM AN INSIGHT INTO THE PROFESSIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND LEARNING HOW THEIR STUDIES TRANSFER INTO THE REAL WORLD OF WORK. THE ASSESSMENT TAKES THE FORM OF A REFLECTIVE LEARNING REPORT AND ACADEMIC POSTER FOCUSED ON A SPECIFIC ELEMENT OF THEIR PLACEMENT.
DURING MY PLACEMENT, I MAINLY WORKED WITHIN THE WATER RESOURCE PLANNING AND WATER QUALITY TEAM WHICH OVERSEES THE USAGE AND CONTAMINATION OF WATER AS WELL AS THE ABSTRACTION OF WATER FROM THE LINCOLNSHIRE AREA. MY WORK INVOLVED THE SOUTH FORTY FOOT CATCHMENT, USING GIS SOFTWARE CALLED EASIMAP TO MAP ABSTRACTION POINTS ALONG THE FOOT. MY SECOND PROJECT WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A CONSTRUCTED WETLAND IN THESE LOCATIONS. DURING MY PLACEMENT, I WAS ABLE TO GIVE TWO MAJOR PRESENTATIONS WHICH HELPED ME TO DEVELOP MY PERSONAL SPEAKING AND TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS. I ALSO USED A VARIETY OF SOFTWARE DURING THE PLACEMENT INCLUDING EASIMAP, EXCEL AND EDRMS, AND DEVELOPED A LOT OF PROBLEM-SOLVING AND CRITICAL SKILLS.
MY PLACEMENT WITH THE EAST MIDLANDS AMBULANCE SERVICE (EMAS) WAS FANTASTIC. I REALLY ENJOYED MYSELF AND FOUND IT INTERESTING. IT WAS QUITE EYE OPENING TO GET AN INSIGHT INTO EMAS AND HOW THIS RELATES TO GEOGRAPHY, AS THE RESEARCH THEY ARE DOING IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I AM CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPUTY HEAD OF CLINICAL AUDIT AND RESEARCH ON AN ABSTRACT AND A POSTER THAT IS BEING SENT TO MADRID FOR A CONFERENCE. IT IS ABOUT CARDIAC ARREST RESPONSE TIMES AND HOW THIS CAN BE IMPROVED. I ALSO GOT THE CHANCE TO SIT IN ON 999 CALLS TO HELP ME GET AN INSIGHT AS TO WHERE THE DATA THAT I HAVE BEEN ANALYSING COMES FROM AND TO UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF SOME OF THE CALLS.
WORKING WITH LINCOLNSHIRE RIVERS TRUST ALLOWED FOR A REAL-TIME LOOK INTO THE DIFFERENT CONSERVATION PROJECTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE THROUGHOUT LINCOLNSHIRE AND HOW WE AS PEOPLE HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT.  I BELIEVE THAT IN DOING A PLACEMENT IT HAS ALLOWED A BROADER KNOWLEDGE ON HOW GEOGRAPHY LINKS WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTEXTUALISE WHAT YOU ARE LEARNING ABOUT DURING THE TIME OF STUDY TO ALLOW AN IN-DEPTH UNDERSTANDING OF TOPICS AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT WE LEARN AS GEOGRAPHERS.
IN THE THIRD YEAR STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERTAKE AN OPTIONAL CONSULTANCY PROJECT. STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM A NUMBER OF VARIED PROJECTS PUT FORWARD BY LOCAL ORGANISATIONS WHO SUPPORT THEM THROUGHOUT THE PROJECTS PHASES. THE MODULE IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY AND DEVELOP NEW SKILLS AND UNDERSTANDING IN AN AREA OF INTEREST. THE STUDENT PRODUCES A REPORT FOR THE BUSINESS FULFILLING AN AGREED PROJECT BRIEF AND ALSO CREATE AN ACADEMIC POSTER SUMMARISING THE MAIN POINTS OF THE PROJECT.
OUR STUDENTS HAVE PRODUCED REPORTS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSISTED A NUMBER OF ORGANISATION WITH THEIR STRATEGIC PLANS OR EXPLORED RESEARCH AREAS THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PURSUE.
"I THINK THAT IT IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING DIFFERENT OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT. ALSO, I THINK THAT IT IS IDEAL FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY NEED DIRECTION IN CHOOSING CAREERS AS IT PROVIDES AN INSIGHT INTO THE CAREERS AVAILABLE IN PARTICULAR SECTORS."
'IT MAKES AN EXCITING CHANGE FROM THE USUAL MODULES AND GIVES YOU INVALUABLE EXPERIENCE FOR YOUR CV. IF YOU ARE ALREADY LOOKING TO WORK IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR, A PLACEMENT IS THE PERFECT WAY TO TRIAL IF IT IS RIGHT FOR YOU."
"I FELT AS THOUGH I WAS PARTAKING IN IMPORTANT WORK AND DIDNT FEEL AS THOUGH I WAS JUST DOING A PROJECT FOR THE SAKE OF IT WHICH I FEEL MADE ME ENGAGE FULLY WITH THE PLACEMENT. THE PLACEMENT MET MY EXPECTATIONS WITH THE PROJECT BEING FUN TO WORK ON, VERY INTERESTING AND GAVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT REAL LIFE GEOGRAPHY WORK CAN BE."
"GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH RELEVANT, UP-TO-DATE ISSUES WHICH I AM PASSIONATE ABOUT. I REALLY ENJOYED WORKING ALONGSIDE PROJECTS WHICH WILL MAKE AN IMPACT ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITY."
"THE EXPERIENCE GAVE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND REAL LIFE EXPECTATIONS OF A WORKPLACE SUCH AS DEADLINES AND MEETING CRITERIA. THE PROJECT ALLOWED ME TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL-LIFE WORKINGS OF RESEARCH PROJECTS FROM START TO FINISH. MAPS PRODUCED WERE USED FOR OTHER WORK BY THE YMCA FOR GOVERNMENT FUNDING."
"I ENJOYED LEARNING ABOUT PLANNING LAW AND ALSO LEARNING ABOUT NEW JOBS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED WITH A HUMAN GEOGRAPHY DEGREE. WRITING THE CLIENT-FACING GUIDE IN ACCESSIBLE LANGUAGE ALLOWED ME TO PRACTISE WRITING IN USER-FRIENDLY LANGUAGE, A KEY SKILL IN ITSELF THAT I CAN USE IN THE WORK PLACE AND SOMETHING I DID NOT PREVIOUSLY (BEFORE THE PLACEMENT) ALWAYS GET TO PRACTISE WHEN WRITING ACADEMIC ESSAYS."
"THE PLACEMENT WAS AN INTERESTING PROJECT CONTAINING THE KIND OF WORK I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING IN THE FUTURE. THERE WAS A CLEAR OBJECTIVE OF WHAT NEEDED TO BE STUDIED AND HOW TO FIND THE NECESSARY INFORMATION REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE RESEARCH."
"I AM SO GLAD I CHOSE TO DO A PLACEMENT DURING MY THIRD YEAR. IT HAS GIVEN ME THE EXPERIENCE FOR MY CV AND THE CONFIDENCE IN MY WORK AND ABILITIES. THIS PLACEMENT HAS PROVEN MY INTEREST IN GIS AND I AM NOW LOOKING TO APPLY FOR GIS ANALYST ROLES, IDEALLY WITH THE NHS."

COMPETITION | BRITISH SCIENCE WEEK  | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNDO YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN? OF QUARTZ YOU DO!
GROW YOUR OWN CRYSTAL' COMPETITION WILL RECEIVE A GOODIE BAG WORTH OVER 30. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS GROW THE BIGGEST AND BRIGHTEST SALT CRYSTALS FOLLOWING THE RECIPE BELOW, ADDING IN YOUR OWN EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS TO MAKE THEM SPECTACULAR! IT'S AS EASY AS 1,2,3!", "ALL ENTRIES MUST BE RECEIVED BY 5PM ON WEDNESDAY 13 MARCH WITH A WINNER BEING ANNOUNCED ON THURSDAY 14 MARCH, AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN'S BRITISH SCIENCE WEEK EVENT. FULL TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAN BE FOUND BELOW.", 'GOOD LUCK!
THE RECIPE
HERES A BASIC RECIPE (DONT FORGET TO ADD YOUR OWN INGREDIENTS SUCH AS FOOD COLOURING TO MAKE THE CRYSTALS BIG AND BRIGHT):
AT FIRST, THE SALT WILL DISSOLVE VERY QUICKLY, BUT AS YOU CONTINUE TO ADD MORE IT WILL EVENTUALLY COLLECT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN WHICH MEANS THE SOLUTION HAS BECOME SUPER-SATURATED.
2.ONCE YOU HAVE A SUPER-SATURATED SOLUTION, POUR THIS INTO A GLASS CONTAINER SO YOU CAN EASILY SEE WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE. PLACE IT SOMEWHERE SAFE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.
6. SEND US A PHOTO! TO SUBMIT YOUR ENTRY SNAP A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOUR CRYSTALS GROWN FROM HOME AND SEND THEM TO US VIA EMAIL, DM OR TAG US ON SOCIAL MEDIA. MAKE SURE TO USE THE#UOLCRYSTALS.
ENTRIES CAN BE MADE BY PHOTOGRAPHING CRYSTALS GROWN AT HOME AND SENDING THE PHOTOGRAPH TO THE PROMOTER EITHER BY EMAIL AT COHSENQUIRIES@LINCOLN.AC.UK OR BY POSTING THE PHOTOGRAPH ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND TAGGING THE COLLEGE OF HEALTH AND SCIENCE (INSTAGRAM @UOLHEATH_SCIENCE). INCLUDED CHANNELS ARE X, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM.
YOU MAY WANT TO TRY AVOIDING THE NUCLEATION STAGE ALTOGETHER AND INTRODUCE SEED CRYSTALS TO YOUR COOLED, SUPER-SATURATED SOLUTION. PERFORM STEPS 1-5 ABOVE AND CHOOSE A CRYSTAL WITH A LARGE FLAT SURFACE AS YOUR SEED. MAKE A NEW SUPER-SATURATED SALT SOLUTION AND ADD YOUR SEED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE STEP 3 ONCE THE SOLUTION HAS COOLED TO ROOM TEMPERATURE.
IMPURITIES IN THE ORIGINAL SALT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE PROCESS. THIS CAN MAKE THE RESULTING CRYSTALS LOOK MORE VIBRANT BUT CAN ALSO HINDER THEIR FORMATION. EXPERIMENT!
THE SHAPE AND SURFACE OF THE CONTAINER MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE, SO YOU MAY WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES.
THE SCIENCE: NUCLEATION AND GROWTH OF SALT CRYSTALS
ANY SUBSTANCE THAT HAS A HIGHLY ORDERED STRUCTURE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A CRYSTAL. TYPICALLY, THESE ARE SOLID MATERIALS IN WHICH THE ATOMS ARE ARRANGED IN A PERIODIC AND SYMMETRICAL MANNER.
ITS QUITE EASY TO FORM SALT CRYSTALS AT HOME FROM NORMAL TABLE SALT DISSOLVED IN WATER BUT ITS A BIT TRICKIER TO FORM LARGE ONES! THE SALT THAT WE ADD TO OUR FOOD (IN SENSIBLE AMOUNTS) IS MADE UP OF TINY LITTLE CRYSTALS. RATHER THAN TURN THESE SMALL CRYSTALS DIRECTLY INTO LARGER ONES, WE MUST FIRST DISSOLVE THE SALT IN SOME WATER TO FORM A SALT SOLUTION (BOXES 1 AND 2), FROM WHICH WE CAN MAKE LARGER CRYSTALS.
THIS PROCESS IS SPLIT INTO TWO MAIN PHASES: NUCLEATION AND GROWTH. THE NUCLEATION STAGE IS THE APPEARANCE OF CLUSTERS IN WHICH A SMALL NUMBER OF ATOMS LOCALLY ASSEMBLE IN A MANNER THAT RESEMBLES THE ARRANGEMENT OF ATOMS FOUND IN LARGE CRYSTALS (BOX 3). WHEN ADDITIONAL ATOMS COMBINE WITH THE SMALL CLUSTERS, THEY EVENTUALLY GROW INTO LARGER CRYSTALS (BOX 4).
FOR THIS PROCESS TO WORK, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE A VERY HIGH CONCENTRATION OF SALT IN YOUR SOLUTION; THE HIGHER THE CONCENTRATION, THE MORE FAVOURABLE THE ORDERED CRYSTAL STRUCTURE BECOMES COMPARED TO THE DISORDERED SALT SOLUTION. TO MAKE YOUR SALT SOLUTION AS CONCENTRATED AS POSSIBLE, YOU MUST INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER WHILE ADDING THE SALT (BOX 2). THIS MAKES WHAT IS KNOWN AS A SUPER-SATURATED SOLUTION, WHICH MEANS THAT THE SOLUTION CONTAINS MORE SALT THAN IT USUALLY WOULD (I.E., AT EQUILIBRIUM). IT IS THIS SUPERSATURATION THAT IS THE MAIN DRIVER OF THE INITIAL NUCLEATION (BOX 3). IF THE SALT CONCENTRATION IS HIGH ENOUGH IT BECOMES MORE FAVOURABLE FOR THE SALT TO FORM SMALL CLUSTERS THAN TO BE IN SOLUTION.
THE FINAL STAGE IS THE GROWTH OF THESE SMALL CLUSTERS INTO LARGE CRYSTALS (BOX 4). THIS SHOULD BE DONE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND IS A VERY SLOW PROCESS (IT CAN TAKE DAYS!). LEAVE YOUR SOLUTION IN A COOL PLACE, AWAY FROM ANY DISTURBANCES SUCH AS WASHING MACHINES, DRUM KITS, OR HELICOPTERS.
THE MULTI-PROFESSIONAL HUB (OCCUPYING THE GROUND-FLOOR OF 179, FACING THE HIGH STREET) IS A COLLABORATIVE SPACE ESPECIALLY DEVELOPED FOR STUDENT-RUN CLINICS OPENED TO BOTH MEMBERS OF THE WIDER UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY AND IN SOME INSTANCES THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

IT CONSIDERS HOW FAMILIAL CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE CHURCH; INTERNAL PRESSURES WITHIN THE CHURCH; AND THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE DIOCESE INFLUENCED AND AFFECTED THE CONTENTS OF HIS REGISTERS DURING HIS TENURE.
THESIS TOPIC: THE INSTITUTION OF MEROVINGIAN QUEENSHIP
TRAVIS LINEHAN IS A PART-TIME MPHIL/PHD STUDENT IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES. HE ACHIEVED A BA HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK AND OBTAINED AN MA IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN.
S INTERESTS ARE IN BOTH FRANKISH HISTORY AND THE STUDY OF HISTORICAL QUEENSHIP AND HIS THESIS, SUPERVISED BY DRS GRAHAM BARRETT AND ROBERT PORTASS, IS FOCUSED ON DEFINING QUEENSHIP AS AN INSTITUTION WITHIN THE MEROVINGIAN KINGDOMS, USING A MIXTURE OF PERSONAL LETTERS, RECORD EVIDENCE, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE, AND CONTEMPORARY HISTORIES WRITTEN BY FIGURES SUCH AS GREGORY OF TOURS.", '
VAL MARDEN IS A PART-TIME MPHIL/PHD STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE. SHE OBTAINED HER BA IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER BEFORE WORKING WITHIN VARIOUS GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS AND THE RAF, AND BEFORE TAKING EARLY RETIREMENT FROM FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT IN 2016. SHE GAINED HER MA (WITH DISTINCTION) IN THE STUDY OF THE COUNTRY HOUSE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER IN 2018. HER DISSERTATION EXAMINED THE DECORATION OF EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH COUNTRY HOUSE FURNITURE WITH ANIMAL FORMS AND MOTIFS.
VALS THESIS CONTINUES THE THEME OF ANIMAL REPRESENTATIONS, AS SHE EXPLORES THE POTENTIAL MEANINGS BEHIND SOME OF THE CREATURES SCULPTED IN STONE AT LINCOLN CATHEDRAL DURING THE YEARS 1250-1350, AN IMPORTANT TIMESCALE ENCOMPASSING SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT BUILDING PROJECTS. SUCH IMAGES HAVE OFTEN BEEN DISMISSED AS MEANINGLESS, MERELY DECORATIVE, GROTESQUE OR JUST AMUSING JAPES BY MASONS, YET THEY ARE SITUATED IN IMPORTANT SPACES WHERE THEY WERE SEEN BY BOTH LAITY AND THE CLERGY. VALS RESEARCH EXAMINES THE LIKELY SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ANIMALS AND MONSTERS IN THE SPACES THEY INHABIT, HOW THE REPRESENTATIONS OF CREATURES CHANGE OVER TIME AND WHAT EFFECT THEY MAY HAVE HAD ON THEIR DIFFERENT VIEWERS.
NICOLA STUDIED FOR A BA IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND POLITICS AT MANCHESTER, AND THEN WORKED FOR MANY YEARS AT THE BBC AS A CURRENT AFFAIRS PRODUCER AND EDITOR.

INSPIRED BY LETTERS WRITTEN BY SENIOR CHURCHMEN TO MEROVINGIAN PRINCESSES IN THE LATE 6TH AND EARLY 7TH CENTURY URGING THEM TO SECURE THE CONVERSION OF THEIR PAGAN HUSBANDS BY OBEYING THE SCRIPTURES AND BY FOLLOWING THE EXAMPLE OF THEIR COMMON ANCESTOR QUEEN CLOTHILDE, WIFE OF CLOVIS I, SUE IS INTERESTED TO KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT FEMALE INTERGENERATIONAL INFLUENCES IMPACTED ON WOMEN AS AGENTS OF CHRISTIANISATION IN THE MEROVINGIAN AND ANGLO-SAXON PERIODS. HER THESIS POSES TWO MAIN QUESTIONS. FIRSTLY, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON WOMEN, HOW DO CONTEMPORARY TEXTS AND LETTER COLLECTIONS OF MEROVINGIAN GAUL PORTRAY THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND ATTITUDES TOWARDS, MAINTAINING THE ELITE FAMILY UNIT? AND SECONDLY, AS A CONSEQUENCE, TO WHAT EXTENT DID FAMILY HERITAGE AND INTERGENERATIONAL INFLUENCES IMPACT ON THE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS AND ACTIONS OF YOUNGER GENERATIONS OF WOMEN?

THERE IS CONSIDERATION OF THE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THESE FAMILIES EMPLOYED TO SURVIVE, MAINTAIN AND EXTEND INFLUENCE.
THESIS TOPIC: THE MEMORY OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS AND VIKINGS AMONG REENACTORS AND LIVING HISTORIANS
JOHN SANDY-HINDMARCH IS A PHD STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL OF FILM AND MEDIA. HAVING ACHIEVED A 1ST IN HISTORY AT NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY IN 2016, HE THEN WENT ON TO OBTAIN AN MA IN VIKING AND ANGLO-SAXON STUDIES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM. SINCE COMPLETING HIS MA IN 2018, JOHNS RESEARCH INTERESTS HAVE SHIFTED FROM ANALYSING THESE EARLY MEDIEVAL PEOPLES IN THEIR HISTORICAL CONTEXT TOWARDS HOW THEY HAVE BEEN PERCEIVED AND REMEMBERED SINCE THEIR HISTORICAL OCCURRENCE, PARTICULARLY IN THE PRESENT.
IN THIS CONTEXT, JOHNS PHD PROJECT EXPLORES HOW THE ANGLO-SAXONS AND VIKINGS ARE UNDERSTOOD, RECEIVED, AND CONNECTED WITH BY ANGLO-SAXON AND VIKING REENACTORS AND LIVING HISTORIANS. EMPLOYING A QUALITATIVE METHOD, JOHN LOOKS TO UNCOVER THE NATURE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANGLO-SAXON AND VIKING PAST, HOW THIS UNDERSTANDING IS FORMED, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE PERIOD ARE EMOTIONALLY CHARGED. THROUGH THIS RESEARCH JOHN HOPES TO MAKE A VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELDS OF BOTH MEDIEVALISM AND MEMORY STUDIES, EXPLORING HOW A PERIOD OF THE DISTANT MEDIEVAL PAST IS BROUGHT INTO RELATION WITH THE PRESENT.
THESIS TOPIC: THE IMPACT OF CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHIES OF ANIMAL RATIONALITY ON ECCLESIASTICAL HUNTING PRACTICES IN 13TH CENTURY ENGLAND
GARY IS A FULL-TIME MPHIL/PHD STUDENT WITH THE SCHOOL OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE. HE OBTAINED HIS BA IN ENGLISH AND HISTORY STUDIES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN/UCNL IN 2019. FOLLOWING THIS, HE CAME TO LINCOLN TO COMPLETE AN MA IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES, WHICH HE ACHIEVED IN 2020.
HE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A DOCTORAL THESIS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF PROFESSOR LOUISE WILKINSON AND DR JAMIE WOOD. HIS WORK SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH 13TH CENTURY PHILOSOPHERS AND THEOLOGIANS SOUGHT TO MAKE SENSE OF AN EXPANDING UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR THROUGH THE PRACTICE OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. AS ANIMALS CAME TO BE SEEN AS MORE COMPLEX THAN PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED, IT BECAME IMPORTANT FOR SCHOLARS TO ESTABLISH A BOUNDARY BETWEEN HUMAN AND NON-HUMAN ANIMALS. FURTHER, THE THESIS SEEKS TO EXAMINE THE WAYS IN WHICH THESE ARGUMENTS INFLUENCED AND INFORMED THE HUNTING PRACTICES OF ENGLISH ECCLESIASTICS AND THEIR SUBORDINATES.
THESIS TOPIC: IBERIAN AND ENGLISH QUEENS HOUSEHOLDS IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
PAULA DEL VAL VALES IS AN MPHIL/PHD STUDENT IN THE SCHOOL OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE. SHE OBTAINED HER BA IN HISTORY IN THE UNIVERSIDAD COMPLUTENSE OF MADRID WITH DISTINCTION IN 2019. IN 2020 SHE COMPLETED HER MA IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES AT KINGS COLLEGE LONDON. HER RESEARCH INTERESTS INCLUDE IBERIAN AND ENGLISH QUEENSHIP, ROYAL HOUSEHOLDS, AND WOMENS HISTORY.
SHE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON HER THESIS SUPERVISED BY PROFESSOR LOUISE WILKINSON AND DR ANTONELLA LIUZZO SCORPO. HER THESIS IS A COMPARATIVE STUDY OFQUEENS HOUSEHOLDS AND COURTS IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY ACROSS THREE KINGDOMS: CASTILE, ARAGON, AND ENGLAND. THROUGH THIS THESIS SHE AIMS TO EXPLORE THE QUEENS ESTABLISHMENTS, THEIR RESOURCES AND PERSONNEL, AND WHETHER THEIR HOUSEHOLDS CONSTITUTED THEIR OWN POWER BASES OR NOT. THIS THESIS WILL ALSO HAVE A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE UNEDITED HOUSEHOLD AND WARDROBE ACCOUNTS OF ELEANOR OF PROVENCE, QUEEN OF ENGLAND.
THESIS TOPIC: THE EPIGRAMMATIST MARTIAL AS SOCIAL COMMENTATOR ON FLAVIAN IMPERIAL ROME
JOE BRODERICK HAS RECENTLY STARTED HIS PHD WITH THE SCHOOL OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE, FOLLOWING HIS GRADUATION WITH A FIRST-CLASS HONOURS DEGREE IN HISTORY BA, AND A DISTINCTION PASS IN HIS MA IN MEDIEVAL STUDIES. HE SPECIALISED IN ROMAN AND EARLY TO MID-MEDIEVAL HISTORY, PARTICULARLY THE ROMAN ARMY AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EMPERORS, AND ANGLO-SAXON ENGLAND. HIS SUPERVISORS FOR HIS PROJECT ARE DR GRAHAM BARRETT AND DR JAMIE WOOD, WITH GRAHAM ACTING AS LEAD SUPERVISOR.
HIS THESIS CONCERNS THE FIRST-CENTURY AD EPIGRAM WRITER MARTIAL, AND HIS POTENTIAL ROLE AS SOCIAL COMMENTATOR. WE CAN SEE THROUGH HIS WORK, IN HIS PRESENTATION OF THE EVERYDAY LIFE OCCURRENCES IN THE ROME OF HIS DAY. BROADLY SPEAKING, THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WILL AIM TO FILL IN SOME OF THE GAPS IN THE SOCIAL HISTORY OF EARLY IMPERIAL ROME THROUGH MARTIALS EPIGRAMS AND ANALYSIS OF THE LITERARY GENRE, GIVING US GREATER AWARENESS OF THE PICTURE OF ROME AND HER PEOPLE MARTIAL SOUGHT TO PORTRAY, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF A SOCIAL (AND TO AN EXTENT LITERARY) HISTORY STUDY.
MANY HISTORIANS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT, DUE TO THE NATURE OF MARTIALS WRITING AND THE CONTRADICTIONS PRESENT WITHIN THE EPIGRAMS, HIS PRESENTATIONS OF EVERYDAY LIFE CANNOT BE TAKEN AT FACE VALUE. SOME HAVE EVEN GONE SO FAR AS TO DISMISS MARTIAL AS A SOURCE OF ANY SERIOUS HISTORICAL STUDY, A CHIEF REASON FOR THIS SELECTION OF MARTIAL FOR MY THESIS. THIS DOES NOT NEGATE THE VALUE OF THE SOURCE FOR RESEARCH, IT JUST NEEDS A MORE GENTLE AND NUANCED EXAMINATION. IT IS ARGUABLE THAT MARTIALS EPIGRAMS OFFER RICHER AND MORE VARIED DEPICTIONS OF ROMES PLACES, OBJECTS, AND STRUCTURES THAN ANY PREVIOUS WORK IN THE ROMAN POETIC TRADITION, AND IT IS THROUGH THESE EXAMINATIONS THE AIMS CAN BE ACHIEVED.
THE MEDIEVAL STUDIES RESEARCH GROUP IS INTERESTED NOT ONLY IN THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD ITSELF BUT ALSO IN THE LATER INTERPRETATION AND REPRESENTATION OF THE MEDIEVAL PAST. OUR MEMBERS WORK WITH, STUDY, AND PUBLISH WIDELY ON ARCHIVES AND MEDIEVAL RECORDS, AND ALSO INTERPRET THE MEDIEVAL PAST FOR THE PUBLIC.
OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE STUDY, EDITING, AND TRANSLATING OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDIEVAL RECORDS, AS WELL AS THE CONTEXTS OF THEIR PRODUCTION AND THEIR PRESERVATION. THIS RESEARCH INCLUDES: DIPLOMATIC MATERIAL AS SOURCES FOR SOCIAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY; THE HISTORY OF MANUSCRIPT LIBRARIES AND THE STUDY OF PALEOGRAPHY; THE CATALOGUING, EDITING, AND STUDY OF CHARTERS AND ARCHIVAL DOCUMENTS FROM EARLY MEDIEVAL SPAIN AND PORTUGAL (EIGHTH TO ELEVENTH CENTURY); PUBLISHED TRANSCRIPTIONS AND TRANSLATIONS OF MEDIEVAL BISHOPS REGISTERS AND COMITAL HOUSEHOLD ACCOUNTS, WITH NEW EDITIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD RECORDS OF HENRY IIIS QUEEN, ELEANOR OF PROVENCE, CURRENTLY IN PREPARATION. WE ARE ALSO DEVELOPING PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES WITH LINCOLN CATHEDRAL LIBRARY AND THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES OF THE UNITED KINGDOM.
INTERPRETING THE MEDIEVAL PAST FOR THE PUBLIC
THE ART FORMS PRESENT IN OUR WORLD - WHETHER THEY BE VISUAL, ARCHITECTURAL, LITERARY, FILMIC, OR OTHERWISE - CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO HOW WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO PERCEIVE BOTH THE MIDDLE AGES AND THE MEDIEVAL. THEY REVEAL SOMETHING ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE MEDIEVAL PAST (REAL OR IMAGINED) AND HOW IT CAN AND DOES MAKE MEANING FOR US IN THE PRESENT. MEDIEVALISM, THEREFORE, ANALYSES NOT (ONLY) THE MEDIEVAL PAST, BUT THE EFFECTS OF MODERN REINVENTIONS OF THAT PAST. THE MEDIEVAL STUDIES RESEARCH GROUP STUDIES THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT THE MIDDLE AGES IS REVISITED, RECONSTRUCTED, AND REPRESENTED THROUGH THE EARLY MODERN ERA RIGHT UP TO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, VIA A RANGE OF TOPICS, INCLUDING: THE MIDDLE AGES IN LITERATURE, FROM EDMUND SPENSER TO HARRY POTTER AND BEYOND; MEDIEVAL FILM, TELEVISION, AND VIDEO GAMES; MEDIEVAL RE-ENACTMENT GROUPS; ENGAGEMENT WITH AND RECEPTION OF MEDIEVAL HERITAGE SITES; ARTHURIAN LITERATURE AND ARTEFACTS, BOTH MEDIEVAL AND POSTMEDIEVAL; MODERN REPRESENTATIONS OF VIKINGS, EARLY ENGLISH AND LATE-MEDIEVAL CULTURES; AND USES OF THE MIDDLE AGES IN POLITICS AND POLITICAL DISCOURSE, INCLUDING SOCIAL MEDIA.

IMPRINT PROJECT | CURRENT PROJECTS | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNABOUT THE PROJECT
IMPRINT IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PROJECT, UNITING CUTTING-EDGE SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS WITH HISTORICAL METHODS. IT USES FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF HAND MARKS FOUND IN THE WAX ON THE REVERSE OF MEDIEVAL SEALS TO CARRY OUT HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT SEALING PRACTICES TELL US ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PRACTICES, ABOUT THE RITUALS INVOLVED WITH EXCHANGE AND ABOUT MEDIEVAL IDEAS OF IDENTITY.
ON THE FORENSICS SIDE, THE STUDY WILL PROVIDE DATA WHICH IS PERTINENT TO ON-GOING AREAS OF RESEARCH IN IDENTITY SCIENCE, PROVIDING A SIGNIFICANT QUANTITY OF MATERIAL FROM A PERIOD LONG BEFORE EXISTING BANKS OF FINGERPRINT DATA, AND CONTRIBUTE TO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE UNIQUENESS OF FINGERPRINTS AND THEIR EVIDENTIAL VALIDITY.
MEDIEVAL SEALS WERE THE EQUIVALENT OF MODERN-DAY SIGNATURES IN LEGAL TERMS, BUT UNLIKE SIGNATURES, THE COMBINATION OF IMAGE AND TEXT ENABLED THEIR OWNERS TO REPRESENT THEMSELVES IN A CERTAIN WAY. BY THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS SOCIETY OWNED AND USED SEAL MATRICES; SOME WERE BESPOKE AND SOME BOUGHT OFF THE SHELF  BUT ALL WERE NECESSARY TO VALIDATE ANY LEGAL DOCUMENT WITH WHICH THE SEALS OWNER WAS CONNECTED.
NOW, IN THE FIRST PROJECT OF ITS KIND,IMPRINTWILL MERGE CUTTING-EDGE FORENSIC TECHNIQUES WITH TRADITIONAL HISTORICAL INVESTIGATION TO ANALYSE THE FINGERPRINTS AND PALM PRINTS FOUND ON THE BACK OF WAX SEALS, LEADING TO NEW DISCOVERIES ABOUT SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS AND LEGAL PRACTICES OF THE TIME, AS WELL AS PROVIDE DATA WHICH WILL HELP CURRENT IDENTITY SCIENCE EXPERTS. 
USING SPECIALIST CAMERAS OPERATED BY TRAINED RESEARCHERS, THE FINGERPRINTS FROM AROUND 1,500 SEALS WILL BE LOGGED ON AN ONLINE DATABASE. THOSE THAT ARE VIABLE WITH BE ANALYSED USING BOTH TRADITION METHODS AND FORENSIC SOFTWARE.
FROM AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE,IMPRINTWILL REVEAL MORE ABOUT MEDIEVAL SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THE BUREAUCRACIES AND PROTOCOLS BEHIND AUTHENTICATION AND SECURITY IN MEDIEVAL ENGLAND. THE RESULTS WILL HELP TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE, ICONOGRAPHIC AND LEGAL CHANGES AND THE PERFORMATIVE ACT OF SEALING, AND HOW THIS REFLECTED SOCIAL AND LEGAL RELATIONSHIPS.
ON THE FORENSICS SIDE, THE STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO CURRENT DEBATES IN FORENSICS, SUCH AS THE UNIQUENESS OF FINGERPRINTS. THROUGH COMPARING THE FINGERPRINTS OF DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS AT DIFFERENT TIMES  MEDIEVAL PRINTS AND ONES FROM MODERN SOCIETY  IMPORTANT STATISTICAL INFORMATION CAN BE GLEANED. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE BUILT INTO DATA REGARDING THE LIKELIHOOD RATIOS OF FINDING THE SAME PRINTS ON TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO HELP ADVANCE FINGER MARK IDENTIFICATION AS A SCIENCE.
THE PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL (AHRC) AND LED BY DR PHILIPPA HOSKIN FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, WITH CO-INVESTIGATOR DR ELIZABETH NEW FROM ABERYSTWYTH UNIVERSITY. THEY WILL WORK ACROSS FIVE CENTRES; LINCOLN CATHEDRAL, EXETER CATHEDRAL, HEREFORD CATHEDRAL, WESTMINSTER ABBEY AND THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF WALES.
FOR THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS, PLEASE VISIT THEIMPRINT PROJECT BLOG.
THIS PROJECT WILL CREATE AN ARCHIVE OF FINGERPRINTS AND ASSOCIATED DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE SEALS, WHICH CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO THE CATALOGUES OF THE FIVE ARCHIVE REPOSITORIES INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT  EXETER CATHEDRAL, HEREFORD CATHEDRAL, LINCOLN CATHEDRAL, THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF WALES AND WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
THE METHODOLOGY USED FOR THE THREE-YEAR PROJECT WILL GO ON TO BENEFIT OTHER REPOSITORIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL MEDIEVAL COLLECTIONS WHICH ARE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, AS THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEIR MATERIAL COULD BE ENHANCED BY EMPLOYING THE SAME METHODS USED.
THE CO-INVESTIGATORS WILL ALSO HOLD WORKSHOPS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT ARCHIVAL PROFESSIONALS, ALONG WITH SPECIALIST CLASSES FOR ARCHIVE STUDENTS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE CUTTING-EDGE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE FOR CURRENT CURATORS AND THE NEXT GENERATION OF THOSE CARING FOR SEALED DOCUMENTS. THESE WILL TAKE PLACE IN AREAS NEAR EACH OF THE CATHEDRALS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT.
AS THE PROJECT PROGRESSES THERE WILL BE A WEBSITE CREATED TO DOCUMENT AND MAKE SEARCHABLE, ALL THE DATA CORRELATED. IT WILL ALSO HOST ONLINE EXHIBITIONS OF THE DOCUMENTS AND SEALS EXAMINED, AS WELL AS WORKSHOPS GEARED TOWARDS THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO OFFER A VIVID INSIGHT INTO MEDIEVAL LIFE.
S FORENSIC ADVISERS, FORENSIC FOCUS, WILL PRESENT THE DATA GATHERED AT CONFERENCES AND HOME OFFICE WORKSHOPS AND TRAINING COURSES. ONCE THE PROJECT CONCLUDES, THE RESEARCHERS AIM TO PUBLISH ITS FINAL CONCLUSIONS IN ACADEMIC JOURNALS IN THEIR FIELD.", 'IMPRINT WILL USE CUTTING-EDGE FORENSIC TECHNIQUES, WORKING WITH FORENSIC FOCUS LIMITED, TO IDENTIFY FINGER, THUMB AND PALM PRINTS ON MEDIEVAL WAX SEALS, AND POSSIBLY ON PARCHMENT AS WELL.
THE SEALS AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS WILL BE DIGITALLY IMAGED USING A FOSTER & FREEMAN CRIME LITE IMAGER. THEY WILL BE ANALYSED USING TRADITIONAL MANUAL FINGERPRINT COMPARISON AS WELL AS DIGITAL METHODS OF FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION SUCH AS AUTOMATED FINGERPRINT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS (AFIS), WHICH USES MATHEMATICAL PATTERNS  OR ALGORITHMS  TO IDENTIFY FINGERPRINTS.
IN ANALYSING THE PRINTS THE FOLLOWING FORENSIC ASPECTS WILL BE INVESTIGATED:
FORENSIC FOCUS LIMITED, BASED IN RIPLEY, DERBYSHIRE, SPECIALISES IN FINGERPRINTS AND FORENSIC QUALITY ASSURANCE WILL PROVIDE THE FINGER MARK VISUALISATION AND FINGERPRINT COMPARISON EXPERTISE, AS WELL AS FORENSIC KNOWLEDGE INPUT. THREE ASSOCIATES WILL BE ALLOCATED TO THE PROJECT AND WILL PROVIDE TRAINING TO THE RESEARCHERS ON USING THE IMAGING EQUIPMENT. ALL ARE FORMER POLICE PERSONNEL WITH SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN THE FINGERPRINT AND FORENSIC IMAGING PROFESSION.

VISITING FELLOW FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK
THIS PROJECT EXAMINES ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN LISBON AND OLD GOA THROUGH THE LENS OF CEREMONIAL ENTRIES IN THE PERIOD C. 15801640. DURING THIS PERIOD, PORTUGALS EUROPEAN CAPITAL, LISBON, AND ITS ASIAN COUNTERPART, OLD GOA, WERE COSMOPOLITAN CENTRES WITHIN THE HABSBURG GLOBAL EMPIRE. CEREMONIAL ENTRIES HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE URBAN DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY MODERN CITIES.
PREVIOUS ANALYSIS (FERNNDEZ-GONZLEZ, 2015) INDICATED THAT TRANSOCEANIC COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS REQUIRED FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TRIUMPHAL CULTURE AND ARCHITECTURE OF EARLY MODERN IMPERIAL CITIES. IT IS STRIKING THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE IMPACT OF CEREMONIAL ENTRIES ON THE ARCHITECTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY MODERN LISBON AND OLD GOA.
ENTANGLED IMPERIAL CITIES EXAMINES BUILDINGS, PRINTED SOURCES AND ARCHIVAL ACCOUNTS RELATING TO ENTRIES AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT IN BOTH CITIES. BY MAKING SUCH A COMPARISON, THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CENTRES AND PERIPHERIES IN THE FIRST GLOBAL AGE.
FORMATIVE SPACESIS A BRITISH ACADEMY-LEVERHULME TRUST SMALL RESEARCH GRANT PROJECT THAT ADDRESSES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHYSICAL SPACES AND NORMATIVE TEXTS SUCH AS MONASTIC RULES IN THE FORMATION OF ASCETIC COMMUNITIES IN EARLY MEDIEVAL IBERIA.
RULEBOOKS FOR MONASTIC LIFE PROPOSE A COMPLICATED DISCIPLINARY REGIME THAT TRAINED MONKS TO ADOPT SPECIFIC BELIEFS AND PRACTICES, WHILE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF MONASTIC SITES  THE SPACES IN WHICH MONKS WERE PRESUMABLY TRAINED IN SUCH PRACTICES  HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL OVER RECENT DECADES. HOWEVER, MINIMAL ATTENTION HAS BEEN DEVOTED TO UNDERSTANDING HOW THE PHYSICAL ORGANISATION OF MONASTIC SPACE RELATED TO THE RULES THAT REGULATED ASCETIC LIFE.
THERE ARE TWO STRANDS TO FORMATIVE SPACES: (1) A SYNTHETIC ANALYSIS OF A SAMPLE OF THE EXTANT MONASTIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL IBERIA (6TH-7TH CENTURY); (2) A COMPARISON OF SUCH SITES WITH CONTEMPORARY IBERIAN MONASTIC RULES. THIS SCOPING STUDY PREPARES THE GROUND FOR A FULLER EXAMINATION OF THE SPATIALITY OF MONASTIC FORMATION IN EARLY MEDIEVAL IBERIA, AND OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASCETIC THEORY AND PRACTICE MORE GENERALLY.
SEXOLOGY, HORMONES AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE LATIN ATLANTIC WORLD: LOCAL POWER AND INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS, 1918-1985 (WELLCOME TRUST AWARD)
THIS FIVE-YEAR PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW HORMONE RESEARCH IMPACTED MEDICAL SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE AND HOW IT TRAVELLED BETWEEN SOUTHERN EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THE PROJECT FOCUSES ON FOUR MEDICAL INSTITUTES IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, ITALY AND SPAIN THAT DEVELOPED HORMONE TREATMENTS TO CURE A NUMBER OF PERCEIVED SEXUAL PATHOLOGIES AND NORMALISE INDIVIDUALS.
THESE INSTITUTES COLLABORATED TO SHAPE A NEW MEDICAL SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE, AND HAD MUTUAL EXCHANGES OF PERSONNEL AND SCIENTIFIC TECHNIQUES. THIS PROJECT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HORMONE RESEARCH CAME TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE; THE EXTENT TO WHICH ENDOCRINOLOGY CHANGED CONTEMPORARY VIEWS OF GENDER AND SEXUALITY; AND HOW THE GLOBAL NORTH AND THE GLOBAL SOUTH HAVE BEEN INTERTWINED IN THE PRODUCTION OF SCIENTIFIC SEXUAL KNOWLEDGE. THIS GRANT ALSO INCLUDES A PROVISION FOR AN INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMME,TRANSITIONAL STATES: HORMONES AT THE CROSSROADS OF ART AND SCIENCE.
WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF LGBTIQ ORGANISATIONS, GENDER CLINICS, ART GALLERIES, A CURATING TEAM, ARTISTS, ACTIVISTS AND ACADEMICS IN THE UK, ITALY AND SPAIN, THE PROGRAMME CONSISTS OF FOUR VIDEO ART INSTALLATIONS AND A NUMBER OF PUBLIC DEBATES IN LINCOLN, LONDON, BARCELONA AND BOLOGNA. IT EXPLORES THE THEME OF HORMONE USE AND ABUSE, BOTH IN THE PAST AND PRESENT, AND AIMS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE IMPORTANT IMPACT HORMONE THERAPIES CAN HAVE ON PEOPLES LIVES.

LATE ANTIQUITY AND THE INHERITANCE OF ROME
THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE AGES, (MEDIEVAL) LATIN WAS USED AS A LEARNED LANGUAGE ACROSS CHRISTIAN EUROPE, AS THE LANGUAGE OF BOTH THE CHURCH AND EDUCATION. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE LEGACY OF ROME IN LATE ANTIQUITY AND BEYOND, FROM THE SOCIOCULTURAL HISTORY OF LATIN, WRITTEN LAW AND LEGAL PRACTICE, TO LETTER-WRITING AND LATE ANTIQUE LITERARY CULTURE. WE ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN TRAVEL AND COMMUNICATION IN THE MEDITERRANEAN.
OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES THE LITERATURE AND CULTURE OF THE HIGH TO LATE MIDDLE AGES, WITH PARTICULAR EMPHASES ON MONSTERS, THE ROMANCE GENRE AND ITS CULTURAL CONTEXTS, AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENGLISH AND CONTINENTAL (ESPECIALLY FRENCH) ROMANCES. CURRENT RESEARCH EXPLORES EMBODIMENTS OF LIMINALITY, HUMAN-ANIMAL RELATIONS, AND THE CONNECTIONS OF BOTH THE VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE ENGLISH ROMANCE AND OUTLAW NARRATIVES, INVESTIGATING HOW MEDIEVAL AUTHORS USE THESE TEXTS TO CHALLENGE OR REINSTATE SOCIAL HEGEMONIES (OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH).
THE HISTORY OF WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES
THE HISTORY OF WOMEN, CHILDREN, AND FAMILIES HAS EMERGED AS A GROWING FIELD OF SCHOLARLY ENQUIRY OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS. OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES THE PLACE OF WOMEN AS DAUGHTERS, WIVES, MOTHERS AND WIDOWS WITH MEDIEVAL SOCIETY, AND INVESTIGATES THE SEXUAL POLITICS OF FAMILIES, HOUSEHOLDS, AND COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL AND LATER MIDDLE AGES. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD AND THE EXISTENCE OF YOUTH CULTURE IN WESTERN EUROPE.
OUR RESEARCH LOOKS AT THE HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN THE MIDDLE AGES. IT INVESTIGATES THE DISSEMINATION AND TRANSMISSION OF THE IDEAS OF THE PARIS SCHOOLS, AND THE INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT OF PETER LOMBARD AND STEPHEN LANGTON.
THE HISTORY OF EMOTIONS HAS EMERGED AS A GROWING FIELD OF SCHOLARLY ENQUIRY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES THE PLACE AND USE OF EMOTIONS AS A TOOL FOR MEDIEVAL COMMUNICATION AND DIPLOMACY THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE AGES, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION ON THE ROLE OF FRIENDSHIP IN CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION IN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA AND THE MEDIEVAL MEDITERRANEAN WORLD. CURRENT RESEARCH INCLUDES A NEW PROJECT ON EMOTIONS, COMMUNICATION, AND DIPLOMACY IN MEDIEVAL IBERIA, WHICH COMBINES HISTORICAL AND LITERARY METHODOLOGIES TO EXAMINE THE INSTRUMENTAL ADOPTION OF EMOTIONAL DISCOURSES ACROSS AND BEYOND GEOPOLITICAL, RELIGIOUS, LINGUISTIC, AND ETHNIC FRONTIERS.

RESEARCH IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF HUMANITIES AND HERITAGE
THE CENTRE FOR CONSERVATION AND CULTURAL HERITAGE RESEARCH BRINGS TOGETHER CONSERVATORS, SCIENTISTS, AND HISTORIANS WORKING CLOSELY TOGETHER TO SHARE THE STRENGTHS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE METHODOLOGIES. THE CENTRE DRAWS ON THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY OF LINCOLN CONSERVATION AND ALSO HOUSES THE HISTORIC AND ANCIENT MATERIALS RESEARCH GROUP AND A GROWING ARCHIVE OF PAINT AND WALLPAPER SAMPLES FROM HISTORIC INTERIORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
ENGLISH STAFF AT LINCOLN ARE CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A DIVERSE RANGE OF RESEARCH THAT SPANS THE MEDIEVAL TO THE CONTEMPORARY. THERE ARE PARTICULAR STRENGTHS IN NINETEENTH CENTURY STUDIES (INCLUDING AGEING), TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY LITERATURE, GOTHIC LITERATURE, WOMENS WRITING, GENDER STUDIES AND AMERICAN LITERATURE. CREATIVE WRITING STAFF ARE HIGHLY PRODUCTIVE AS AUTHORS OF FORMS INCLUDING FICTION, POETRY, GRAPHIC NOVEL, AND PLAYS, AND IN GENRES INCLUDING DYSTOPIAN LITERATURE, FANTASY, AND CRIME FICTION.
OUR RESEARCH EXAMINES THE CREATION, DEVELOPMENT, AND INVOLUTION OF THE MAJOR CHRISTIAN AND ISLAMIC POLITIES OF THE IBERIAN PENINSULA, TOGETHER WITH THE IDEA AND REPRESENTATION OF POWER AND AUTHORITY WITHIN THESE POLITIES. WE USE A RANGE OF SOURCE MATERIALS (FROM CHRONICLES TO ROYAL DIPLOMAS; AND FROM VISIGOTHIC VOTIVE CROWNS TO UMAYYAD IVORY CASKETS) TO UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNING TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO RULERS, AS WELL AS THE PRESTIGE AND POWER THAT CALIPHS, KINGS, AND THEIR COUNSELLORS PRESUMED TO DISPLAY AND DEPLOY.
MEDIEVAL IBERIA HAS BEQUEATHED US AN ASTONISHING ARRAY OF DOCUMENTARY AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTEFACTS WITH WHICH WE CAN EXAMINE THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY OF THIS GEOPOLITICALLY COMPLEX PENINSULA. WE MAKE USE OF THE INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED INSIGHTS EMERGING FROM URBAN AND RURAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS TO POSE NEW QUESTIONS OF THE SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, LIVING ARRANGEMENTS, AND PRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES OF LOCAL SOCIETIES. A LONGSTANDING INTEREST IN CHARTERS UNDERPINS MUCH OF THE RESEARCH OF SOME OF OUR SCHOLARS, WIDENING OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE MULTIPLE CONTEXTS IN WHICH THE WRITTEN WORD SHAPED AND EXPRESSED THE ECONOMIC CONCERNS OF EVEN THE MOST HUMBLE MEMBERS OF THESE SOCIETIES.
AS ROMAN RULE GAVE WAY TO VISIGOTHIC DOMINANCE WITHIN THE IBERIAN PENINSULA, HISPANO-ROMAN CULTURE REMAINED FIRMLY ROOTED IN THE REGION. OUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE RELIGIOUS, SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL HISTORY OF VISIGOTHIC IBERIA, AND THE LEGACY WITHIN THE PENINSULA OF BOTH ROME AND THE VISIGOTHS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN THE WRITING OF HISTORY, PARTICULARLY THE WORKS OF ISIDORE OF SEVILLE, THE PRODUCTION OF POETRY, INCLUDING THAT OF EUGENIUS OF TOLEDO, AND IN THE STUDY AND TRANSLATION OF AUSTRASIAN AND VISIGOTHIC LETTERS. WE HAVE A SPECIAL INTEREST IN LATIN LANGUAGE, LITERACY, AND LITERATURE, FROM LATE ROME TO THE HIGH MIDDLE AGES, INCLUDING THE DE VIRIS ILLUSTRIBUS TRADITION AND LATIN CHRISTIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY.

WHERE APPROPRIATE, FACE-TO-FACE TEACHING IS ENHANCED BY THE USE OF DIGITAL TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY AND MAY BE COMPLEMENTED BY ONLINE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THESE SUPPORT LEARNING OUTCOMES.
ONLINE STUDENT ATTENDANCE REGISTERSHAVE BEEN INTRODUCED SO STUDENTS NO LONGER NEED TO SIGN A PHYSICAL REGISTER IN COMPULSORY FACE-TO-FACE TEACHING SESSIONS. YOU WILL BE GIVEN A UNIQUE SIX-DIGIT CODE AT THE START OF COMPULSORY CLASSES TO REGISTER YOUR ATTENDANCE VIA YOUR PHONE, TABLET OR LAPTOP THROUGH A SIMPLE NEW WEB PLATFORM.
VISITING THE UNIVERSITY
ALL VISITORS TO THE UNIVERSITY ARE ASKED TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE PRIOR, DURING AND AFTER THEIR VISIT TO HELP PREVENT THE SPREAD OF CORONAVIRUS. THE LATEST GUIDANCE CAN BE FOUND ON THE GOV.UK WEBSITE. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT SPECIFIC APPROACHES MAY BE TAKEN BY THE UNIVERSITY FOR CERTAIN EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES. PLEASE LIAISE WITH YOUR RELEVANT UNIVERSITY HOST IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PRIOR TO YOUR VISIT.
THE UNIVERSITY OUTBREAK PLAN FORMS PART OF A SUITE OF PLANS AND DOCUMENTS WHICH AIM TO CREATE A COVID-SECURE CAMPUS AND, TOGETHER, SET OUT HOW THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN WILL SEEK TO SUSTAIN HIGH QUALITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH; PROVIDE A GOOD STUDENT EXPERIENCE; REDUCE THE RISK OF TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS; AND MANAGE THE IMPACT OF A LOCAL OUTBREAK AND CONTROL ANY OUTBREAKS EITHER ON CAMPUS, OR AMONGST STAFF AND STUDENTS. DOWNLOAD THEUNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN OUTBREAK PLAN (PDF).
S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE PLAYS THEIR PART IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE BY BEING RESPONSIBLE IN HOW THEY ACT ON AND OFF-CAMPUS. THIS MEANS FOLLOWING ANY GOVERNMENT RULES,LOCAL AUTHORITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE, AND GUIDANCE FROM THE UNIVERSITY. AT ENROLMENT AND RE-ENROLMENT THIS YEAR, WELL BE ASKING ALL STUDENTS TO SIGN UP TO OUR COMMUNITY LIVING PLEDGE. THIS SETS OUT SOME OF THE STANDARDS OF BEHAVIOUR EXPECTED DURING THESE EXCEPTIONAL TIMES, AND LINKS TO THE UNIVERSITY REGULATIONS, STUDENT CHARTER, AND OUR ONE COMMUNITY VALUES.", '
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS INVITING UNIVERSITY STAFF AND STUDENTS TO COMPLETE A SECOND SHORT, ANONYMOUS SURVEY TO HELP INFORM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) VACCINATION UPTAKE ACROSS OUR UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY.
THE SURVEY IS VOLUNTARY AND OPEN TO ALL STUDENTS AND STAFF AT THE UNIVERSITY, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE HAD THE VACCINE YET. IT IS ANONYMOUS AND RESPONSES WILL NOT BE LINKED BACK TO INDIVIDUALS. IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL TO HAVE AS MANY RESPONSES AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY INFORM OUR PLANNING.AGGREGATED DATA FROM THE SURVEY WILL HELP TO INFORM THE UNIVERSITYS PLANNING TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY AS WE ENTER IN TO THE NEW YEAR. INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL DATA MAY ALSO BE REPORTED TO THE OFFICE FOR STUDENTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BODIES SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, AND PUBLIC HEALTH ENGLAND.
STUDENTS AND STAFF CAN COMPLETE THE SURVEY USING THE LINK BELOW:
THE SURVEY WILL REMAIN OPEN BETWEEN MONDAY 6TH DECEMBER AND FRIDAY 17TH DECEMBER 2021.
FOR FURTHERDETAILS ON HOW THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE WILL BE USED, PLEASE READ OUR PRIVACY NOTICE.
WE HAVE INTRODUCED A NUMBER OF SAFETY MEASURES ON CAMPUS TO MINIMISE THE RISK TO STUDENTS AND STAFF WHILE ENGAGING IN TEACHING AND LEARNING. THESE ARE BASED ON CURRENT GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE.
FIRSTLY, PLEASE REMEMBER THAT IF YOU THINK YOU MAY HAVE ANY OF THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVID-19 INFECTION, STAY AT HOME, BOOK AND TAKE A TEST, INFORM THE UNIVERSITY COVID TEST AND TRACE TEAM, AND FOLLOW GOVERNMENT ADVICE.
UPON ENTERING A BUILDING, STUDENTS SHOULD MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE TIMETABLED SPACE AND ARRIVE ON TIME TO AVOID QUEUING OUTSIDE ROOMS. IF YOU DO HAVE TO QUEUE, PLEASE MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AT ALL TIMES.
STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO FOLLOW ANY ONE WAY SYSTEMS IN PLACE FOR THE BUILDING AND AVOID USING THE LIFTS IN BUILDINGS UNLESS NECESSARY. WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENTRANCES TO TEACHING SPACES, THEY SHOULD FOLLOW THE SIGNAGE OR GUIDANCE OF STAFF MEMBERS WHO WILL IDENTIFY THE ENTRANCE AND EXIT POINTS THAT SHOULD BE USED.
ACCESS TO TEACHING SPACES IS FOR TIMETABLED DELIVERY ONLY. WHEN OPENING OR CLOSING DOORS OR OPERATING LIGHT SWITCHES, ALWAYS USE HAND SANITISER. DO NOT SPEND LONGER IN ENCLOSED TEACHING SPACES THAN SCHEDULED, AND BEFORE YOU LEAVE A TEACHING BUILDING, WASH YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER OR USE THE HAND SANITISER PROVIDED AS YOU EXIT.
IF YOU REQUIRE FIRST AID SUPPORT, PLEASE CONTACT SECURITY ON 01522 886062 IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. YOU CAN ALSO REPORT ANY ISSUES WITH THESE NEW PROCESSES OR IF THEY ARE NOT BEING FOLLOWED BY OTHERS.
STUDENTS WILL BE ORGANISED INTO TEACHING BUBBLES AS FAR AS MODULE ARRANGEMENTS ALLOW. STUDENTS SHOULD NOT MOVE BETWEEN BUBBLES (SWAPPING GROUPS WILL NOT BE POSSIBLE). MOST STUDENTS WILL BE IN SEVERAL BUBBLES, DEPENDING ON THEIR PROGRAMME ARRANGEMENTS. IF STUDENTS HAVE A PROBLEM ATTENDING A SESSION BECAUSE OF TIMING, THEY SHOULD SPEAK TO THEIR PERSONAL TUTOR IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.
AT THE START OF YOUR FIRST SESSION WITH A NEW BUBBLE (TEACHING GROUP), THE TUTOR LEADING THE SESSION WILL DISCUSS THE PROTOCOLS WITH YOU AND ENSURE YOU CAN ASK ANY QUESTIONS. THE SESSION LEAD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING AN ELECTRONIC RECORD OF STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT EACH SESSION.
CLASSROOM-TYPE TEACHING SPACES WILL BE LAID OUT SO THAT ALL STUDENTS ARE SOCIALLY DISTANCED (1.5M PLUS) AND FRONT FACING. SPACES WITH FIXED SEATING WILL BE CLEARLY SIGNED, AND STUDENTS SHOULD ONLY USE THE DEDICATED SEATS AND NOT REMOVE SIGNAGE.
STUDENTS WILL WEAR FACE COVERINGS DURING TEACHING. VISORS MAY ALSO BE WORN AND THESE WILL BE PROVIDED. IN SOME SPECIALIST TEACHING SESSIONS ALTERNATIVE PPE WILL BE USED. STAFF WILL WEAR EITHER A FACE COVERING OR A VISOR DURING TEACHING. SOME STAFF AND STUDENTS MAY BE EXEMPT FROM WEARING A FACE COVERING AND IN THESE CASES A VISOR SHOULD BE WORN. WHERE THERE ARE ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, FO EXAMPLE, LIP-READING REQUIREMENTS, A VISOR WILL BE WORN BY THE TUTOR.
DISINFECTANT WIPES FROM THE SANITISATION STATION SHOULD BE USED TO WIPE DOWN DESKS, CHAIRS, AND ANY SHARED EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS KEYBOARDS. IF POSSIBLE, MAINTAIN FRESH AIR FLOW DURING THE SESSION BY KEEPING DOORS OPEN.
SESSIONS ARE TIMETABLED FOR 45 MINUTES TO ALLOW MOVEMENT TIME AND LIMIT QUEUING ENTERING AND LEAVING THE BUILDING (IN ADDITION TO ANY BUILDING SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS). UPON ENTERING THE BUILDING, SANITISE YOUR HANDS AT ONE OF THE SANITISING POINTS NEAR THE ENTRANCE, OR VISIT THE WASHROOM AND THOROUGHLY WASH YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP AND WATER FOR 20 SECONDS. SANITISE YOUR HANDS REGULARLY DURING THE DAY.
AT END OF THE TEACHING SESSION, STUDENTS WILL LEAVE THE CLASSROOM TEACHING SPACE AND ARE ASKED TO SANITISE HANDS AS THEY EXIT. STUDENTS SHOULD MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCING AND TO REMIND EACH OTHER OF PROTOCOL AS NECESSARY.
STUDENTS ARE REMINDED THAT THROUGH THE COMMUNITY CHARTER, SIGNED ON (RE) ENROLMENT, STUDENTS PROMISE TO ADHERE TO ANY INSTRUCTIONS AROUND COVID-19 SAFETY. STUDENTS WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM WEARING A FACE COVERING AND/OR VISOR IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD EITHER CONFIRM THIS TO THEIR TUTOR AT THE TIME USING THEIR EXEMPTION CARD OR WEAR THE APPROPRIATE LANYARD WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM STUDENT SUPPORT AND INDICATES THEIR EXEMPTION STATUS. STUDENTS MAY WISH TO CONTACT THEIR TUTOR PRIOR TO THE SESSION. EXEMPTION CARDS CAN BE DOWNLOADED AND COMPLETED VIA THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE.
 UNION WILL BE PROVIDING AROUND 420 STUDY SPACES FOR STUDENTS IN THE ENGINE SHED. IT WILL BE OPENFROM9AMTO7PM, MONDAY TO FRIDAY, ALTHOUGH ON OCASSION IT MAYCLOSE AT5PM DUE TO EVENTS TAKING PLACE AT THE SITE.", 'CONTACT TRACING
STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO MAKE SURE CONTACT DETAILS HELD BY THE UNIVERSITY ARE UP TO DATE. THIS WILL ALLOW THE UNIVERSITY TO CONTACT THEM IF A PERSON THEY HAVE BEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH DURING THE TEACHING SESSION DEVELOPS SYMPTOMS.
IN AN EMERGENCY, WORKING WITHIN 2M IS ACCEPTABLE IF YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. FIRST AIDERS WILL BE ISSUED WITH FULL FACE PROTECTION PPE. ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT IMMEDIATELY A DANGEROUS SITUATION IS NOT AN EMERGENCY AND THE USUAL 2M DISTANCE IS REQUIRED.
ON HEARING THE FIRE ALARM, IMMEDIATELY REPORT TO THE DESIGNATED ASSEMBLY POINT AND OBEY INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE FIRE MARSHALL OR SECURITY STAFF AS NECESSARY. ON NO ACCOUNT ARE PEOPLE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY POINT WITHOUT INFORMING THE FIRE MARSHALL, OR TO RE-ENTER THE BUILDING UNTIL THE FIRE CO-ORDINATOR HAS GIVEN CLEARANCE.
ALL BUILDING EXIT PROCEDURES SHOULD BE FOLLOWED IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. ON HEARING THE FIRST ALARM ALL OCCUPANTS MUST IGNORE COVID-19 ONE WAY SYSTEMS AND SIGNS THAT HAVE YELLOW BACKGROUNDS AND BLACK LETTERING, AS WELL AS RED DO NOT ENTER SIGNS THAT ARE FIXED TO FIRE ESCAPE ROUTES AND EXITS, AND EXIT THE BUILDING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, VIA THE NEAREST EXIT.
S ROADMAP, THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN REMAINS OPEN TO ENSURE STUDENTS CAN CONTINUE THEIR LEARNING.STUDENTS CAN ACCESS KEY FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE LIBRARY, STUDY SPACES, SUPPORT SERVICES, AND SOME CATERING OUTLETS. STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MINIMISE THE RISK OF COVID-19 TRANSMISSION ACROSS CAMPUS, INCLUDING ONE-WAY SYSTEMS, ENHANCED CLEANING REGIMES, AND A REQUIREMENT TO WEAR FACE COVERINGS IN ENCLOSED SPACES. THIS OVERALL ADVICE AND GUIDANCE FORA SAFE CAMPUSIS BASED ON GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AND WILL BE UPDATED WHEN REQUIRED.", 'SOCIAL DISTANCING
WHILE LEGAL LIMITS ON SOCIAL CONTACT HAVE LIFTED (AS OF ROADMAP STEP 4 ON 19 JULY 2021), THE GOVERNMENT IS ASKING PEOPLE TO MANAGE RISKS AND LIMIT THE CLOSE CONTACT THEY HAVE WITH PEOPLE THEY DO NOT LIVE WITH. THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO WORK TO REDUCE THE RISKS OF TRANSMISSION TO PROTECT STUDENTS, STAFF, VISITORS AND OUR WIDER COMMUNITY. THIS INCLUDES USE OF ONE-WAY SYSTEMS AND SOCIALLY-DISTANCED SEATING IN MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS TO LIMIT THE NUMBER AND DURATION OF CLOSE CONTACTS INDOORS.WE HAVE ADDED CLEAR MARKINGS IN PLACES ON CAMPUS OF HIGH FOOTFALL AND WHERE QUEUING IS LIKELY, TO HELP PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN AN APPROPRIATE DISTANCE.
T BECOME OVERCROWDED. SOME OF OUR SOCIAL LEARNING SPACES MAY HAVE TO BE CLOSED, OR OPERATE WITH RESTRICTED NUMBERS. HAND SANITISERS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AT ACCESS POINTS AND WITHIN BUILDINGS.", 'THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY HAVE TO BE CHANGED AS THE CAMPUS BECOMES MORE ACTIVE AND WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW STAFF AND STUDENTS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. OF COURSE, THE GOVERNMENTS ADVICE MAY ALSO CHANGE, ALLOWING US TO RELAX SOME RESTRICTIONS, OR REQUIRING US TO TIGHTEN FURTHER.
WHERE POSSIBLE, ONE-WAY SYSTEMS WILL BE DESIGNED, CREATING A SERIES OF LOOPS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD FOLLOW WHEN MOVING AROUND BUILDINGS. IF CORRIDORS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WIDE (I.E. EXCEEDING 2M IN WIDTH), TWO LANES WILL BE CREATED, IN WHICH A ONE-WAY SYSTEM SHOULD BE OBSERVED (E.G. ALWAYS KEEP LEFT). IN SECTIONS OF CORRIDORS WHERE QUEUES ARE LIKELY TO FORM, SUCH AS OUTSIDE KITCHEN AREAS AND TOILETS, CORRIDORS WILL BE MARKED AT 2M INTERVALS TO HELP ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING IS MAINTAINEDWHILE QUEUING.
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, LIFTS SHOULD BE AVOIDED AT ALL TIMES AND USED ONLY BY THOSE UNABLE TO USE STAIRS, OR FOR THE TRANSPORT OF LARGE, HEAVY, OR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WHERE TRANSPORT ON STAIRWAYS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE OR SAFE. IN MOST BUILDINGS, WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE STAIRWAY CONNECTING FLOORS AND, IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, STAIRWAYS WILL BE DESIGNATED AS AN UP ROUTE OR A DOWN ROUTE TO PREVENT FACE-TO-FACE INTERACTION, AND TO ENSURE DISTANCING IS MAINTAINED. WHERE ONLY ONE STAIRWELL TO A FLOOR IS PRESENT A CENTRAL MARKING WILL BE PLACED, AND A ONE-WAY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED (E.G. ALWAYS KEEP LEFT), OR IN SOME VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, WHERE THERE IS CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT DOWN THE STAIRWAY, A VISUAL CHECK TO ENSURE THE ROUTE IS CLEAR WILL OPERATE  SIGNAGE WILL CLEARLY INDICATE THOSE STAIRCASES.
THE LIBRARY IS OPERATING WITH LIMITED CAPACITY TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING CAN BE MAINTAINED AND TO ENABLE THE LIBRARY STAFF TO WORK SAFELY AS THEY RESTOCK SHELVES AND DEAL WITH ENQUIRIES. AS WITH OTHER PARTS OF CAMPUS, ONE-WAY SYSTEMS AND OTHER COVID-SECURE MEASURES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCEDWITH CLEAR SIGNAGE.STUDY SPACES ARE OPEN AND AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS TO USE (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF GROUP STUDY ROOMS).
YOU CAN STILL BROWSE THE SHELVES AND TAKE OUT BOOKS IN PERSON USING THE SELF-SERVICE MACHINES OR YOUCAN RESERVE BOOKS FOR COLLECTION FROM THE GROUND FLOOR FREEZONE AREA.LIBRARY USERS WHO ARE CLINICALLY EXTREMELY VULNERABLE CAN ARRANGE FOR BOOKS TO BE POSTED TO THEM.RETURNED BOOKS ARE QUARANTINED FOR 72 HOURS. A RANGE OF ONLINE SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR STUDENTS. MORE DETAILS CAN BE FOUND ON THE LIBRARY MICROSITE.
SEMINAR ROOMS WILL BE OPERATING AT A SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER CAPACITY THAN NORMAL AND WILL BE ARRANGED TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN STAFF AND STUDENTS IN SEMINAR AND GENERAL TEACHING ROOMS WILL BE NO LESS THAN 1.5M. WE RECOGNISE THAT THIS IS LESS THAN THE IDEAL MINIMUM OF 2M BUT IT REMAINS GREATER THAN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATIONS RECOMMENDED MINIMUM SOCIAL DISTANCE OF 1M AND, IN LINE WITH GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE, WE HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO FURTHER MITIGATE THE RISKS.
WE AREENSURING THAT ALL DESKS AND CHAIRS FACE THE SAME DIRECTION (NO FACE-TO FACE LAYOUTS), SHORTENING THE LENGTH OF SESSIONS, PROVIDING WIPES TO ENABLE STAFF AND STUDENTS TO WIPE SURFACES BEFORE AND AFTER USE, AND ENSURING THAT ROOM VENTILATION OPERATES EFFECTIVELY. ACCORDINGLY, THE LAYOUT OF ROOMS MUST NOT BE CHANGED, NOR SHOULD ADDITIONAL DESKS, OR CHAIRS, BE MOVED IN OR OUT OF TEACHING ROOMS. IF POSSIBLE, DOORS AND WINDOWS SHOULD BE OPENED TO MAINTAIN THE CIRCULATION OF AIR.
IN ALL LABORATORIES AND WORKSHOPS, THE MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY OF THE ROOM SHOULD BE SET AT NO MORE THAN 25% OF THE NORMAL MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY (FOR A LAB WITH FIVE BAYS, EACH WITH EIGHT FUME HOODS, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF WORKERS IN THE LAB SHOULD NOT EXCEED TEN). WORK SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT IN SHIFTS, TO ALLOW THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WORKERS TO ACCESS A SPACE, WHILE MAINTAINING A MINIMUM NUMBER OF PERSONS WORKING AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WORKING SPACE SHOULD BE VACATED UPON COMPLETION OF WORK, OR WHERE ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF DELAY IS EXPECTED - FOR EXAMPLE, A THREE-HOUR EXPERIMENT IS RUNNING, AND NO OTHER WORK CAN BE COMPLETED DURING THIS TIME. DURING SHORTER PERIODS OF DELAY, THE AREA SHOULD BE VACATED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE WORKER, USING COMMON SENSE AND CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE WHO MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF THE SPACE.
IN LABORATORY AND WORKSHOP ENVIRONMENTS, FLOORS SHOULD BE MARKED AT 2M INTERVALS TO HELP WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. WHERE BAY SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE, THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN ONE PERSON PER HALF BAY (MAXIMUM TWO PEOPLE PER FULL BAY). WHERE THERE ARE MULTIPLE POINTS OF ACCESS TO THE LABORATORY OR WORKSHOP, A ONE-WAY SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, WITH CERTAIN DOORS BEING DESIGNATED FOR ENTRY AND OTHERS FOR EXIT (SEE ILLUSTRATON, RIGHT). WHERE POSSIBLE, WIDE FOOTWAYS IN BAY-SYSTEM LABORATORIES OR WORKSHOPS SHOULD BE MARKED INTO TWO LANES TO ALLOW FOR MOVEMENT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, WITH PEOPLE KEEPING TO THE LEFT. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, A COMMUNICATION APPROACH SHOULD BE MAINTAINED BETWEEN PEOPLE IN A WORKSPACE, SO MOVEMENT OF ONE INDIVIDUAL CAN OCCUR IN EITHER DIRECTION WHILE OTHERS REMAIN WITHIN THE BAYS AND MAINTAIN THE 2M MINIMUM DISTANCING. ALL WORKERS IN BAY-SYSTEM LABORATORIES OR WORKSHOPS SHOULD WORK AT LEAST 2M FROM ANY PRIMARY FOOTWAYS, AND WORK FACING AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL RESERVATION OF A BAY WHERE POSSIBLE TO MINIMISE ANY FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT WITH OTHERS.
IN OPEN PLAN LABORATORIES AND WORKSHOPS, FLOOR MARKINGS AT 2M INTERVALS SHOULD BE MADE (SEE ILLUSTRATION, RIGHT), AND A ONE-WAY SYSTEM IMPLEMENTED AROUND THE ROOM WITH SPURS AS NECESSARY TO PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT CANNOT REASONABLY BE MOVED, PROVIDED A 2M DISTANCE CAN BE MAINTAINED. WHERE MULTIPLE POINTS OF ACCESS AND EGRESS TO THE LABORATORY OR WORKSHOP ARE PRESENT, ONE-WAY SYSTEMS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, WITH CERTAIN DOORS BEING DESIGNATED FOR ENTRY ONLY AND OTHERS FOR EXIT ONLY.
THIS GUIDANCE IS IN ADDITION TO STANDARD HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDANCE. A DEGREE OF COMMON SENSE WILL BE REQUIRED WHEN UNDERTAKING WORK IN LABORATORIES OR WORKSHOPS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A SPILLAGE OF A TOXIC CHEMICAL IN A LAB RESULTED IN THE BLOCKAGE OF A DESIGNATED EXIT ROUTE OF A ONE-WAY SYSTEM OUTLINED IN THIS GUIDANCE, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE SPILL TO EVACUATE THE AREA. THE USE OF ANOTHER, NON-DESIGNATED ROUTE WOULD BE PERMISSIBLE AS THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPILL IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN THE BRIEF REDUCTION IN SOCIAL DISTANCING NEEDED TO SAFELY LEAVE THE ROOM.
WHEREVER POSSIBLE, CAMPUS CATERING OUTLETS WILL BE OPENED FOR A TAKEAWAY SERVICE BUT WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN ALL OF THE OUTLETS, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE SOCIALLY DISTANCING QUEUING WOULD INTERFERE WITH THE SAFE OPERATION OF THE BUILDING. SEATING WILL ALSO BE LIMITED GIVEN THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE SOCIAL DISTANCING.
TO SUPPORT THE SAFE OPERATION OF OUR CATERING OUTLETS, WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES. HOT DRINKS WILL ONLY BE SERVED IN DISPOSABLE (AND RECYCLABLE) CUPS, BUT THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL DISPOSABLE CUP CHARGE WHILE THIS RESTRICTION REMAINS IN PLACE.
ALL CONDIMENTS WILL BE IN SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE SACHETS. ALL UNIVERSITY OUTLETS WILL BE CASH AND CONTACT-FREE, SO PAYMENT WILL BE VIA YOYO, OR CONTACTLESS CARD, AND SCREENS WILL BE POSITIONED TO PROTECT BOTH STAFF AND CUSTOMERS DURING FACE-TO-FACE TRANSACTIONS. MENUS WILL BE SIMPLIFIED TO IMPROVE THE FLOW THROUGH THE OUTLETS, REDUCE QUEUING, AND TO MAKE IT EASIER TO EAT AWAY FROM THE USUAL RESTAURANT FACILITIES.
THE UNIVERSITYS MOBILE VAN AND COFFEE CARTS WILL ALSO BE POSITIONED IN KEY OUTSIDE SPACES, WHERE SOCIALLY DISTANCED QUEUING WILL BE EASIER TO MANAGE. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE SERVICE OF HOT FOOD AND DRINKS. THE UNIVERSITY IS ALSO LOOKING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OUTDOOR CATERING FACILITIES TO SUPPORT STAFF AND STUDENTS.
WITHIN AREAS WITH SERVICE DESKS, APPROPRIATE QUEUING ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE CLEARLY LAID OUT FOR CUSTOMERS. THIS WILL INCLUDE WHERE TO QUEUE FROM, TAPE (OR SIMILAR) ON THE FLOOR TO KEEP 2M SOCIAL DISTANCING AS THEY QUEUE, AND CLEAR SIGNAGE. RAILING OR TAPE WILL BE REQUIRED WHERE LONGER QUEUESMAYFORM.
WE MAY NEED TO REGULATE ENTRY SO THAT THE PREMISES DO NOT BECOME OVERCROWDED. THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE WHEN THIS IS NEEDED. TO PREVENT CUSTOMERS COMING TOO CLOSE TO DESKS, TEAMS SHOULD CONSIDER USING A TEMPORARY BARRIER ACROSS THE DESK TO BETTER ENFORCE SOCIAL DISTANCING. TO ENSURE GOOD PRACTICE, HIGH CONTACT SURFACES SUCH AS SERVICE DESKS AND COMMUNAL COMPUTER EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE WIPED DOWN FREQUENTLY. FREQUENCY OF CLEANING SHOULD INCREASE WITH INCREASED USAGE, BUT A MINIMUM OF TWICE DAILY IS SUGGESTED WHERE POSSIBLE. FOR THOSE WORKING BEHIND THE DESKS AND THEREFORE AT HIGHER RISK GIVEN UNAVOIDABLE FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT, THE UNIVERSITY WILL PROVIDE APPROPRIATE SHIELDING.
MANY BUILDINGS ON CAMPUS HAVE SMALL, COMMUNAL KITCHEN AREAS FOR USE BY STAFF AND STUDENTS. TO ENSURE SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES ARE ADHERED TO, COMMUNAL KITCHENS SHOULD EMPLOY A ONE OUT, ONE IN PROCEDURE, WITH NO MORE THAN ONE PERSON BEING IN THE AREA AT ANY TIME.
IN THE CASE OF MUCH LARGER KITCHENS, FLOOR MARKINGS AT 2M INTERVALS MAY BE EMPLOYED TO ALLOW FOR A WELL-SPACED QUEUE WITHIN THE KITCHEN AREA. WHERE THE MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY OF A KITCHEN AREA HAS BEEN REACHED, PEOPLE SHOULD FORM A QUEUE IN THE ADJOINING CORRIDOR, WITH THE START OF THE QUEUE BEING SET 2M AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE KITCHEN AREA TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO EXIT THE AREA WHILST MAINTAINING A 2M DISTANCE FROM THOSE QUEUEING. COMMONSENSE WILL BE NEEDED IN THESE AREAS SO THAT QUEUES DO NOT RESTRICT ACCESS TO OTHER FACILITIES.
PRIOR TO THE HANDLING OF COMMUNAL ITEMS IN THE KITCHEN, SUCH AS KETTLES AND CUTLERY, PEOPLE MUST WASH THEIR HANDS FOR AT LEAST 20 SECONDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE TO PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF SURFACES. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT COMMUNAL CUTLERY AND MUGS ETC. SHOULD BE AVOIDED, AND PERSONAL ONES TAKEN HOME TO BE WASHED, NOT LEFT IN COMMUNAL AREAS. WHERE THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE, COMMUNALITEMS SHOULD BE WASHED THOROUGHLY USING SOAP AND WARM WATER, DRIED USING A PAPER TOWEL OR TOWEL DESIGNATED FOR THIS PURPOSE (NOT A HAND TOWEL), AND PUT AWAY IMMEDIATELY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF TRANSFER OF CONTAMINATION TO OTHER PEOPLE.
SPORTS CENTRE STAFF CAN ADVISE ON APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES AND THEY CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ONLINE SUPPORT FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS WHO WISH TO EXERCISE AND NEED HELP WITH THEIR FITNESS REGIMES. AS THE GYM REOPENS, IT WILL BE OPERATING WITH A REDUCED CAPACITY TO ENABLE SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE UNIVERSITY IS ALSO LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCATING SOME GYM EQUIPMENT AT OTHER LOCATIONS ON CAMPUS TO MAXIMISE ACCESS TO SPORT AND EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES. LIMITED TOILET FACILITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE BUT CHANGING FACILITIES WILL INITIALLY BE CLOSED SO USERS WILL NEED TO SHOWER AND CHANGE IN THEIR OWN ACCOMMODATION.
IT IS LIKELY THAT THE SPORTS CENTRE AND DANCE STUDIO WILL BE NEEDED FOR TEACHING THROUGHOUT THE FIRST SEMESTER SO ACCESS TO THOSE FACILITIES IS LIKELY TO BE SEVERELY RESTRICTED. THE SPORTS CENTRE STAFF WILL BE FOCUSING ON SUPPORTING OUTDOOR ACTIVITY WHEREVER POSSIBLE, INCLUDING PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR SOCIALLY DISTANCED OUTDOOR EXERCISE AND CLASSES. IN ADDITION, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ONLINE SESSIONS AND PERSONAL TRAINING.
IN THE CASE OF SINGLE, LOCKABLE FACILITIES, PLEASE LEAVE THE FACILITY IN A RESPECTABLE CONDITION. IF WAITING TO USE SUCH A FACILITY, ENSURE YOU STAND AT LEAST 2M FROM THE DOOR TO ALLOW THE PREVIOUS OCCUPANT THE APPROPRIATE SPACE TO LEAVE WITHOUT BREAKING SOCIAL DISTANCING GUIDELINES.FOR THE MAJORITY OF COMMUNAL TOILETS ON CAMPUS, SOCIAL DISTANCING WILL BE DIFFICULT. CONSEQUENTLY, MOST COMMUNAL TOILETS WILL CHANGE TO A ONE OUT, ONE IN SYSTEM WITH NO MORE THAN ONE PERSON BEING IN THE ROOM AT ANY TIME, AND WHERE USERS ARE ASKED TO USE A KNOCK AND CALL SYSTEM. WHERE THIS IS IN PLACE, A NOTICE WILL BE DISPLAYED ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR. IN ADDITION, A SIGN ON THE INSIDE OF THE DOOR WILL REMIND PEOPLE OF GOOD HAND WASHING PRACTICE GIVEN THIS WILL BE A HIGHER RISK AREA WITH CONTACT ON THE DOORS BY ALL USERS.
TO PROTECT STAFF AND OTHER STUDENTS, THE UNIVERSITY REQUIRES ALL STUDENTS TO WEAR A FACE COVERING DURING FACE-TO-FACE TAUGHT SESSIONS. ACADEMIC STAFF ARE REQUIRED TO WEAR EITHER A VISOR OR FACE COVERING, BUT SHOULD ENSURE THEIR TEACHING IS ACCESSIBLE. ALL STAFF AND STUDENTS MUST ALSO WEAR A FACE COVERING IN OTHER ENCLOSED COMMUNAL SPACES ON UNIVERSITY PREMISES, OR OUTDOORS, WHERE SOCIAL DISTANCING IS NOT POSSIBLE. THIS INCLUDES, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN QUEUING, ENTERING, OR LEAVING BUILDINGS AND IN THE LIBRARY. READ OURPOLICY ON FACE COVERINGS (PDF)
IF YOU ARE EXEMPT FROM WEARING A FACE COVERING AND/OR VISOR, PLEASE ENSURE YOU COMPLETE AN EXEMPTION CARD AND BRING THIS WITH YOU TO SHOW THE TUTOR. YOU MAY WISH TO EMAIL YOUR TUTOR BEFORE THE SESSION IF YOU ARE EXEMPT. THE UNIVERSITY CAN PROVIDE A LANYARD FOR YOU TO CARRY AN EXEMPTION CARD. YOU CAN FIND DETAILS ON EXEMPTION CARDS AND PRINT THEM FROM THE GOVERNMENT WEBSITE AT GOV.UK.
FOR SOME SUBJECTS YOU WILL BE PROVIDED WITH ADDITIONAL PPE WHERE THE NATURE OF THE TEACHING ACTIVITY REQUIRES CLOSER CONTACT AND SOCIAL DISTANCING ISNT POSSIBLE  FOR EXAMPLE, SOME LAB OR PRACTICAL SESSIONS. THIS WILL BE EXPLAINED BY YOUR TUTOR AND THE PPE PROVIDED AT THE START OF THE SESSION.

SUPPORTING THE CREATION AND EVALUATION OF A WORKPLACE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MENTOR PROGRAMME WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE FORCE (LPF)
LPF HIGHLIGHTED THE PHYSICAL WELLBEING OF STAFF AS A PRIORITY AREA AND WANTED TO ENCOURAGE STAFF TO BECOME MORE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE. THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF ANY FORMALISED NATIONAL GUIDANCE, OTHER THAN BASIC FITNESS REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND LPF WISHED TO DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THIS. DR HANNAH HENDERSON WORKED ALONGSIDE THE ASSIGNED SENIOR OFFICER, INSPECTOR RACHEL HARRISON, AND CREATED A PEER SUPPORT INITIATIVE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE STAFF TO BECOME MORE ACTIVE, THE FITNESS MENTORS PROGRAMME. THE PROGRAMME REQUIRES A MENTOR TO MEET WITH THE REFERRED COLLEAGUE AND CONDUCT A SERIES OF HEALTH MEASURES (E.G. BLOOD PRESSURE). THE MENTORS PROVIDE TAILORED SUPPORT AND ADVICE ON HOW TO BECOME MORE ACTIVE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A 10-WEEK PROGRAMME. MENTORS DEDICATE AT LEAST FOUR HOURS A WEEK TO THE ROLE (TWO HOURS OF WHICH CAN COME FROM THEIR DUTY TIME). DR HENDERSON COLLABORATED WITH INSPECTOR HARRISON TO WRITE A HANDBOOK FOR THE FITNESS MENTOR PROGRAMME. THE DOCUMENT DETAILED EACH STAGE OF THE PROCESS, FROM THE POINT OF REFERRAL, TO THE 10-WEEK PROGRAMME AND POST PROGRAMME SUPPORT. THE HANDBOOK INCLUDED ALL ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK THAT THE FITNESS MENTORS AND PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE. AS THE POST OF A FITNESS MENTOR WAS AN APPOINTED VOLUNTARY ROLE, DR HENDERSONS EXPERTISE WAS LEVERAGED TO ESTABLISH THE SKILLS AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED OF CANDIDATES, AND SHE COLLABORATED WITH TWO OTHER POLICE STAFF FOR THE RECRUITMENT AND INTERVIEW PROCESS.
DR HENDERSON AND HER TEAM HAVE CONTINUED THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PROJECT WHEN THEY WERE FUNDED BY LPF TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAMME; EXAMINING HOW MANY STAFF ACCESSED THE SCHEME, WHAT IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH WERE OBSERVED, AND HOW EFFECTIVE THE OVERALL PROCESS WAS. THE FITNESS MENTORS PROGRAMME RECEIVED NATIONAL RECOGNITION, WHEN IT WAS NOMINATED AND SUCCESSFULLY AWARDED THE PROTECTING THE WORKFORCE AWARD BY THE NATIONAL POLICE WELLBEING SERVICE (NPWS), KNOWN AS OSCAR KILO, IN MARCH 2020. THIS WAS AN INCREDIBLE ACHIEVEMENT FOR ALL INVOLVED.
REDUCING INJURY IN THE POLICE AND MILITARY
THE MODERN POLICE FORCE IS REQUIRED TO CARRY OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT, BUT TO DATE THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CONSIDERATION OF AN OFFICERS CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY CARRY THIS LOAD. WEIGHT BARING (OR LOAD CARRIAGE) IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF INJURY, POLICE POPULATIONS DISPLAYING HIGH INJURY RATES WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS.
ACADEMICS WITHIN THE SCHOOL OF SPORT AND EXERCISE SCIENCE, NAMELY DR FRANKY MULLOY, DR DAN BISHOP AND DR ANTHONY GORMAN, EMBARKED ON A RELATIONSHIP WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE TO INVESTIGATE THE ANECDOTAL REPORTS OF A HIGH INJURY PREVALENCE. A MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED, USING 386 POLICE OFFICERS, WHICH IDENTIFIED THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF LOWER BACK (84% OF ALL OFFICERS SURVEYED), NECK (76%), AND SHOULDER (66%) ISSUES WERE PREVALENT IN OPERATIONAL POLICE OFFICERS WITHIN THE LAST 12-MONTHS ALONE. LINKS TO THE OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT WERE IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL MECHANISMS FOR THE LONG-TERM INJURIES.
BUILDING ON THIS WORK, DR FRANKY MULLOY AND PROF DAVID MULLINEAUX ESTABLISHED A 3-YEAR KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER PARTNERSHIP (INNOVATE UK) WITH ARKTIS LTD. ARKTIS ARE A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF POLICE AND MILITARY TACTICAL WEAR, AND THEY PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF THE 43 POLICE FORCES IN THE UK WITH TACTICAL VESTS AND EQUIPMENT. THIS FULLY FUNDED PROJECT SUPPORTED MORE IN-DEPTH RESEARCH WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE THROUGH AN INDUSTRY PARTNER. WITH A KTP ASSOCIATE ADDED TO THE TEAM, DR MATTHEW ELLISON, 38 POLICE OFFICERS WERE BROUGHT INTO THE MOTION CAPTURE HUB. THE AIM OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO ESTABLISH HOW WELL TACTICAL VESTS FIT THE BODY DURING DYNAMIC TASKS, AND TO INVESTIGATE HOW BEST TO LOAD OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT ON THE BODY. OUR FINDINGS IDENTIFIED WHERE TACTICAL VESTS COULD BE ALTERED TO REDUCE STRESS ON THE SMALLER NECK AND BACK MUSCLES, MODIFYING COORDINATION OF THE HEAD AND TORSO IN RUNNING. THROUGH THESE FINDINGS, ARKTIS TACTICAL VESTS HAVE NOW BEEN ALTERED WITH NEW PROTOTYPE VESTS BEING TESTED PRIOR TO BEING RELEASED GLOBALLY. THE NEW DESIGNS SHOULD REDUCE THE HIGH NUMBER OF OVERUSE INJURIES SEEN IN POLICE FORCES. THE PARTNERSHIP IS ALSO FOCUSING ON MILITARY LOADING TO REDUCE INJURIES IN THE FIELD.

AHMAD BUBA | DECOLONISING AT LINCOLN | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNAHMAD THE ARCHITECT
AHMAD BUBA STUDIED A MASTERS DEGREE IN ARCHITECTURE BETWEEN 2013 AND 2015 AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. AFTER COMPLETING HIS STUDIES, HE WORKED IN AN ARCHITECTURAL FIRM IN NOTTINGHAM BEFORE RETURNING TO NIGERIA TO REBUILD SCHOOLS IN HIS HOME CITY OF MAIDUGURI WHICH HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE ARMED GROUP BOKO HARAM.
AHMAD THE ARCHITECT
AHMAD SAID: THE HIGHLIGHT OF MY CAREER HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO ME TO BUILD SCHOOLS. THE NORTHEAST OF NIGERIA. WHERE I GREW UP. HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY BOKO HARAM INSURGENCY. BOKO HARAM TRANSLATES TO WESTERN EDUCATION IS FORBIDDEN. THE INSURGENTS HAVE DESTROYED OVER 1,400 SCHOOLS AND FORCED MORE THAN 3 MILLION CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL IN THE REGION.
BUILDING SCHOOLS IS THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL FOR LONG-TERM RESISTANCE AGAINST BOKO HARAM. THE SCHOOLS ARE DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE THE VICTIMS OF THE INSURGENCY WHO ARE MOSTLY ORPHANS. THE SCHOOL IS THE ONLY WEAPON THAT PLAYS SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THEIR LIVES. IT HELPS THEM TO OVERCOME THEIR TRAUMA AND IT ALSO HELPS THEM TO HAVE HOPES ABOUT THEIR FUTURE."
AHMAD CONTINUED: THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF BORNO STATE, SENATOR KASHIM SHETTIMA, GAVE ME THE PLATFORM TO ACTUALISE MY DREAMS WHEN NO ONE BELIEVED IN ME AND MY APPROACH TO ARCHITECTURE. HE GAVE ME THE FREEDOM TO DO WHATEVER I THINK IS GOOD, WHICH RESULTED IN BUILDING SCHOOLS AND MANY OTHER COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
DISCUSSING HIS TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, AHMAD SAID: THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE IN ADVANCED STUDY IN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN AND RESEARCH, THIS HELPED ME TO DEVELOP COMPETENCE TO BECOME INTER-CULTURALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY PROFICIENT. MOST OF MY RESEARCH AND PROJECTS WERE ON HOW TO DEVELOP AND IMPROVE COMMUNITIES. I AM NOW HAPPILY PUTTING THEM INTO PRACTICE.
MY FONDEST MEMORY OF LINCOLN IS MY FIRST TIME SEEING THE SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE BUILDING. ARCHITECTS ALWAYS HAVE A BUILDING THEY FALL IN LOVE WITH, MINE FOR SURE IS THIS BUILDING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. I STILL FEEL CONNECTED TO IT NOW.
IT WAS A BIG CHANGE BEING AWAY FROM HOME TO STUDY IN THE UK. FORTUNATELY, THE UK IS TOLERANT AND MULTICULTURAL COUNTRY WHERE YOU FIND PEOPLE FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH. I MET A LOT OF INTERESTING PEOPLE AND I LEARNED ABOUT OTHER PART OF THE WORLD.
WHEN ASKED WHAT ADVICE HE HAD FOR NEW STUDENTS BEGINNING THEIR STUDIES, AHMAD SAID: DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK, UNIVERSITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT HITTING THE BOOKS. THEY SHOULD CONSIDER ALL FOUR DIMENSIONS OF LIFE AS THEY STRIVE TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES  PHYSICAL, SPIRITUAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND SOCIAL. THEY SHOULD SPEND TIME EACH DAY DEVELOPING EACH OF THESE FOUR DIMENSIONS.

WE RECOGNISE THAT A COLONIAL CURRICULUM IS UNREPRESENTATIVE, INACCESSIBLE, AND PRIVILEGED IN NATURE. IT IS UNREPRESENTATIVE BECAUSE IT SELECTIVELY CONSTRUCTS TEACHINGS WHICH EXCLUDE CERTAIN CRUCIAL NARRATIVES. IT IS INACCESSIBLE BECAUSE IT PREVENTS MANY OF ITS RECIPIENTS FROM IDENTIFYING WITH THE NARRATIVES CONSTRUCTED. IT IS PRIVILEGED, BECAUSE IT ENSURES THE CONTINUED PARTICIPATION, COMFORT, AND FLOURISH OF A SELECT GROUP OF PEOPLE, IN BOTH AN ACADEMIC AND A WIDER SOCIETAL CONTEXT. THESE FEATURES IN HIGHER EDUCATION ARE DETRIMENTAL TO MINORITY GROUPS, MARGINALISING THEM IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF WAYS.
A DECOLONISED APPROACH SEEKS TO REFOCUS THE CAMERA, AS IT WERE, TO ALLOW FOR A FULL PICTURE, A MORE REALISTIC REPRESENTATION OF THE WORLD THAT CHALLENGES AND INTERROGATES THE EUROCENTRIC WORLD VIEW.

WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE EDUCATION OF STUDENT PARAMEDICS AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION INTO REGISTERED PRACTICE?
AS AN EDUCATIONALIST WHO SPECIALISES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARAMEDICS, MY RESEARCH AIMS TO LOOK AT THE IMPACT ON NEWLY QUALIFIED PARAMEDICS WHOSE EDUCATION HAS BEEN SHAPED BY THE TURBULENCE OF THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IT WILL USE A CASE STUDY-BASED APPROACH FOLLOWING THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF A GROUP OF NEW PARAMEDICS, BRINGING TOGETHER THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE IMPACT AS THEY START THEIR CAREERS IN THE EMERGENCY AMBULANCE SERVICE, AND AS THEY TRANSITION FROM A NOVICE BEGINNER INTO BECOMING EXPERIENCED CLINICIANS.
TO EXAMINE THE USE OF COLLABORATIVE LESSON STUDY IN DEVELOPING THE INCLUSIVE CLASSROOM CULTURE IN PRIMARY MATHEMATICS.
I HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY THE MERITS OF LESSON STUDY AND HOW IT DEEPENS TEACHERS MATHEMATICAL UNDERSTANDINGS AND DEVELOPS A COLLABORATIVE CULTURE OF TRUST AND SUPPORT AMONG TEACHERS. MY RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON THE USE OF LESSON STUDY TO PROMOTE INCLUSION FOR ALL PUPILS IN THE CONTEXT OF PRIMARY MATHEMATICS.
BY USING A CONSTRUCTIVIST GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH MY STUDY WILL ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCES OF NURSE WORKING IN U.K. GENERAL PRACTICE SETTINGS OF EXISTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIABETES CPD AND WHETHER THEY CONSIDER THAT THESE MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR CURRENT PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS.
TEACHING OUR KIDS TERRORISM: THE INCORPORATION OF FUNDAMENTAL AND EXTREMIST ISLAM INTO THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION CURRICULUM OF ENGLAND AND WALES TO INCREASE RELIGIOUS LITERACY AND DECREASE RELIGIOUS IGNORANCE.
THE COMPOSITION OF SOCIETY HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS, PREDOMINANTLY WHITE NATIONS HAVE FAST BECOME BOTH MULTI-CULTURAL AND MULTI-ETHNIC. THIS DIVERSITY HOWEVER, HAS IN SOME CASES RESULTED IN SOCIETAL TENSIONS. TO COMBAT SUCH DIFFICULTIES, THE GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO COMBAT SUCH TENSION; CITING EDUCATION AS ONE OF ITS METHODS. IT IS THE PREMISE OF MY RESEARCH TO CONSIDER HOW RELIGIOUS EDUCATION (RE) CAN BE USED AS A TOOL TO ENSURE THAT RELIGIOUS LITERACY IS PREVALENT ACROSS SOCIETY, TO ENSURE THAT EVENTS SUCH AS HATE CRIME AND DISCRIMINATION DO NOT OCCUR AS A RESULT OF RELIGIOUS IGNORANCE. RECENT RESEARCH INTO RE HAS CONFIRMED THAT THE SUBJECT ITSELF HAS NOT ADAPTED TO THE CURRENT SOCIO-POLITICAL CLIMATE, AND THUS, THE SUBJECT IS IN NEED OF SIGNIFICANT REFORM. THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME THERE IS SCOPE TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS FOR ITS AIMS, CONTENT AND PEDAGOGIES. THUS I AM INTERESTED IN: HOW ISLAM IS CURRENTLY TAUGHT IN RE; WHETHER THE TEACHING IS MEETING THE GOVERNMENTS AIMS; AND, WHETHER THE INCLUSION OF PARTICULAR ISLAMIC CONCEPTS INTO THE CURRICULUM OR UTILISING ALTERNATIVE PEDAGOGIES WITHIN THE CLASSROOM WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE TEACHING OF ISLAM AS A MEANS TO REDUCE SOCIETAL TENSIONS.
AS A TEACHER EDUCATOR, I AM INTERESTED IN HOW TEACHERS CAN BE SUPPORTED TO BECOME AGENTIC, THAT IS, TO ACT WITH COMPETENCE,PURPOSE, AUTONOMY, AND REFLEXIVITY TO BRING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGE WITHIN THEIR OWN PRACTICE.MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED ON LESSON STUDY AS A VEHICLE TO ENHANCE TEACHER AGENCY AND EFFICACY IN SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS AMONGST TEACHERS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN CROSS-BORDER SHARED EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN IRELAND AND NORTHERN IRELAND.

BY USING AN ETHNOGRAPHIC CASE STUDY, MY MIXED METHOD RESEARCH WILL EXPLORE THE ATTITUDES OF HEADTEACHERS, TEACHERS OF TAMAZIGHT, PUPILS, AND THEIR PARENTS TOWARDS THE TEACHING OF TAMAZIGHT LANGUAGE IN TWO SCHOOLS OF ORAN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CITIES IN ALGERIA. THE FINDINGS WILL AID TO ACKNOWLEDGE LANGUAGE PLANNERS, POLICY MAKERS AND EDUCATION SECTOR MANAGERS IN ALGERIA OF HOW PEOPLE PERCEIVE TAMAZIGHT LANGUAGE TEACHING AND LEARNING, THEREFORE, MORE SUITABLE AND PRACTICAL CURRICULAR REFORMS CAN BE PERFORMED.
EDUCATIONAL LOW ATTAINMENT: LOOKING BEYOND THE LABEL TO ENSURE EQUITY IN EDUCATION.
THE FOCUS OF MY MASTERS DISSERTATION WAS THE GENDER ATTAINMENT GAP AT GCSE IN WHICH I ANALYSED THE QUESTION: IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE ACHIEVEMENT IN THE GENERAL CERTIFICATE OF SECONDARY EDUCATION (GCSE) AN ISSUE THAT REQUIRES INTERVENTION? THIS RESEARCH HAS LED ME TO ANALYSE THE EDUCATIONAL CONCEPT OF LOW ATTAINMENT AT SCHOOL. WHO DECIDES WHO IS A LOW ATTAINER AND WHY DO WE USE SUCH LABELS TO CATEGORISE STUDENTS? WHAT DAMAGE DO WE CAUSE TO STUDENTS WHEN WE LABEL THEM AS SUCH, AND HOW CAN WE COMBAT THIS TO MAKE EDUCATION MORE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL?
I AM CURRENTLY WORKING AS A TEACHER EDUCATOR IN MATHEMATICS AND STEM IN PRIMARY EDUCATION. MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MATHEMATICAL MODELLING AS A PEDAGOGY TO ENABLE LEARNERS TO USE MATHEMATICS TO UNDERSTAND THE WIDER WORLD AND ENGAGE IN COMPLEX PROBLEM-SOLVING.A CASE STUDY OF FIVE TEACHERS IS DOCUMENTED, HIGHLIGHTING THEIR JOURNEY OF ENGAGING WITH MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IMPLEMENTING IT IN THEIR CLASSROOM. TEACHER COMPETENCIES, INCLUDING CHALLENGES AND SUCCESSES OF IMPLEMENTING MATHEMATICAL MODELLING IN THE CLASSROOM, ARE EXPLORED. THE RESEARCH ALSO DISCUSSES THE BENEFIT OF TEACHERS ENGAGING INRELEVANT LITERATURE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ACTION RESEARCH (MC NIFF, 2022) AND THE TEACHING FOR ROBUST UNDERSTANDING (TRU) FRAMEWORK (SCHOENFELD, 2015) ARE KEY ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH AND PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN TEACHER REFLECTION.
I AM INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE VALUE OF SCIENCE PRACTICAL WORK, IN TERMS OF EFFECTIVENESS AND AFFECTIVE VALUE, IN TERTIARY EDUCATION FOCUSING ON BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO SHED LIGHT ON CURRENT PRACTICAL PRACTICES IN THE TEACHING OF SCIENCES SO AS TO BENEFIT UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND FUTURE SCIENTISTS IN UTILISING THE BEST KNOWLEDGE RESOURCES SO AS TO FURTHER THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD.

FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS TEACHING WITHIN FURTHER EDUCATION (FE) IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY APPARENT OPPORTUNITY FOR LEARNERS TO PARTICIPATE AND ENGAGE WITHIN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS INADEQUATE. I AM HOPING THROUGH RESEARCH TO IDENTIFY LIMITATIONS OF PROGRESS AND SUPPORT FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION WITHIN FE FROM POLICY MAKERS. WHILST THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITHIN EDUCATION IS WELL UNDERSTOOD ALONGSIDE BENEFITS IDENTIFIED, THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY SUBSTANTIAL NEED FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OFFERINGS WITHIN FE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CRUCIAL IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE.
MY RESEARCH INTENDS TO EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF ACTIVE LEARNING METHODS ON INTERNATIONAL STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND PROGRESSION. WITH A FOCUS ON EGYPTIAN STUDENTS STUDYING AT A UK UNIVERSITY BRANCH CAMPUS IN CAIRO, MY RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH ACTIVE LEARNING IS EMBEDDED AS A TEACHING METHOD FOR ACADEMICS AND STUDENTS. I HOPE TO IDENTIFY ANY BARRIERS PREVENTING THE USE OF ACTIVE LEARNING AND THE PERCEPTION OF BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF ACTIVE LEARNING AS OPPOSED TO MORE TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS, FOR THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT EXPERIENCE.
OUR WORK EXPLORES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE, EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POWER. WE HAVE SPECIAL INTERESTS IN TWO AREAS: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL FORCES AND EDUCATIONAL THINKING, PRACTICE AND INSTITUTIONS; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL AND CO-OPERATIVE FORMS OF EDUCATION FOR DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES. OUR RESEARCHERS EXAMINE THESE THEMES IN STUDIES OF ALTERNATIVE, CO-OPERATIVE AND POPULAR EDUCATION; CRITICAL PEDAGOGY; CURRICULUM; DISCOURSE; EDUCATIONAL POLICY AND POLICY AFFECTING EDUCATION; EDUCATIONAL REFORM; KNOWLEDGE AND IDEOLOGY; LABOUR; THE ORGANISATION AND POLITICAL ECONOMY OF EDUCATION; SOCIAL MOVEMENTS; AND TECHNOLOGY.
WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?
EDUCATION IS A KEY SITE OF CULTURAL, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL POWER, WITH THE CAPACITY TO REINFORCE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES AND INJUSTICES OR TO CHALLENGE AND OVERCOME THEM. IT IS BOTH CONSEQUENTIAL IN THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AND A KEY SITE OF DOMINATION AND RESISTANCE IN GLOBAL POLITICAL ECONOMY. UNDERSTANDING THE POLITICS OF EDUCATION CRITICALLY IS THUS VITAL FOR STUDENTS, EDUCATORS, COMMUNITIES AND PUBLICS.
RICES RESEARCHERS ARE MEMBERS OF AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS, EDUCATORS AND ACTIVISTS WORKING TO ADVANCE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE POLITICS OF EDUCATION IN SOCIETY, AND TO TRANSFORM EDUCATIONAL THINKING AND PRACTICE IN THE INTERESTS OF SOCIAL JUSTICE. IN ADDITION TO PRODUCING ACADEMIC THEORY AND RESEARCH, WE CO-OPERATE WITH EDUCATORS, EDUCATIONAL LEADERS AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVISTS TO DESIGN RESEARCH-BASED APPROACHES TO STRENGTHENING PRAXIS.

LINCOLNSHIRE LEARNING LAB IS A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO HELP IMPROVE THE LEARNING OF ALL CHILDREN AND THE WORKING ENVIRONMENTS FOR TEACHERS WITHIN LINCOLNSHIRE.
ONE OF THE MAIN AIMS OF THE GROUP IS TO BRING ACADEMIC RIGOUR AND EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH INTO THE CLASSROOM BY ENGAGING THE THREE KEY STAKEHOLDERS  TEACHERS, ACADEMICS, AND ANYONE INVOLVED OR INTERESTED IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM, SUCH AS PARENTS AND EDUCATIONAL CONSULTANTS.
THE ASSESSMENT COMPANION FOR THINKING SKILLS (ACTS) PROJECT IS THE CULMINATION OF A THREE-YEAR ERASMUS+ FUNDED STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND ORGANISATIONS IN THE UK, FINLAND, AND LATVIA.
THE AIM OF THE PROJECT WAS TO DEVELOP, TRIAL, AND DISSEMINATE A SUITE OF DIAGNOSTIC AND FORMATIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS TO BE USED BY CLASSROOM TEACHERS FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESS IN PUPILS THINKING. THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH HAS DEVELOPED NEW LEARNING TOOLS, LEARNING AND TEACHING METHODOLOGIES, AND PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES THAT SUPPORT PUPILS THINKING.THE AIM IS THAT THESE RESOURCES WILL IMPROVE THE EDUCATION OF PUPILS AND THE TRAINING OF PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE TEACHERS.
THE PROJECT ARISES FROM THE EXPRESSED NEED OF PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE TEACHERS INVOLVED IN THINKING SKILLS PROJECTS IN THREE COUNTRIES, LATVIA, FINLAND, AND THE UK, AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE FROM OUR DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS AND COMMON INTENTIONS. CHANGES TO NATIONAL CURRICULA THAT EITHER INCORPORATE OR WILL INCORPORATE THINKING SKILLS ARE TAKING PLACE IN EACH OF THE PARTNER COUNTRIES.
PRESCRIPTIVE STANDARDS FOR TEACHER COMPETENCY INCLUDING HELPING PUPILS PROGRESS IN THEIR THINKING COVER BOTH PRE-SERVICE AND IN-SERVICE TEACHERS IN THE UK, LATVIA, AND FINLAND. HOWEVER, FEW GUIDELINES ARE AVAILABLE AS TO HOW THE TEACHERS SHOULD GO ABOUT INTEGRATING THE TEACHING OF THINKING AND HOW THEY SHOULD CHANGE THEIR ASSESSMENT PRACTICE TO GAUGE THEIR IMPACT ON PROGRESS IN THINKING.
THROUGH THIS PROJECT, THE FOLLOWING HAS BEEN DEVELOPED:
 A DESCRIPTION OF THINKING SKILLS COMPETENCIES (WHAT DOES GOOD THINKING LOOK LIKE AND SOUND LIKE?) AN ACHIEVEMENT INDICATOR THAT SIGNPOSTS COMPETENCY AND PROGRESSION IN THINKING SKILLS GUIDANCE FOR PROGRESSION BETWEEN COMPETENCY SIGNPOSTS THAT SUPPORT BOTH THE TEACHER AND PUPILS IN KNOWING HOW TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE NEXT SIGNPOST ASSESSMENT TOOLS THAT ARE GENERIC ENOUGH TO BE APPLIED ACROSS DISCIPLINES BUT WITH SUBJECT-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND EXAMPLES GUIDELINES FOR INTERPRETING ASSESSMENT RESULTS IN TERMS OF  HOW AM I DOING AS A TEACHER? AND, WHAT DO I NEED TO CHANGE? AS WELL AS, HOW WELL ARE MY PUPILS DOING?
ALL THESES CAN BE FOUND BY SEARCHING IN THE LIBRARY CATALOGUE. PDFS MAY BE AVAILABLE WHERE INDICATED FROM THE RESEARCH REPOSITORY.

THE ASCENTS 121 SUPPORT FOR SCIENCE PROGRAMME  LED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AND SUPPORTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LEEDS, THE UNIVERSITY OF LIVERPOOL, UCLS INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK  TRAINED STEM UNDERGRADUATES TO PROVIDE 23 WEEKLY ONE-TO-ONE ACADEMIC MENTORING SESSIONS TO YEAR 11 SCIENCE PUPILS WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING GCSE SCIENCE ATTAINMENT.
MENTEES WERE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL MEALS AND PREDICTED TO ACHIEVE A LEVEL 3-5 IN GCSE SCIENCE. SESSIONS WERE DELIVERED OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL HOURS (BEFORE OR AFTER SCHOOL) IN CLASSROOMS OR LABORATORIES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A TEACHER. THE TOPIC OF EACH SESSION WAS CHOSEN BY PUPILS.
THIS TRIAL OF ASCENTS 121 SUPPORT FOR SCIENCE WAS FUNDED BY THE EDUCATION ENDOWMENT FOUNDATION (EEF) AND THE WELLCOME TRUST AS PART OF THE JOINT IMPROVING SCIENCE EDUCATION FUNDING ROUND.
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ONE-TO-ONE ACADEMIC MENTORING IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE ATTAINMENT AND MAY ALSO INCREASE SUBJECT ENJOYMENT AND INTEREST. THE EEFS TEACHING AND LEARNING TOOLKIT ESTIMATES THAT ONE-TO-ONE TUITION CAN BOOST LEARNING BY +5 MONTHS ADDITIONAL PROGRESS FOR ALL PUPILS, AND THAT IT CAN BE PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR DISADVANTAGED PUPILS AND FOR THOSE WITH LOW ATTAINMENT.
WHILE ALMOST ALL THE PROGRAMME WAS DELIVERED, THE TRIAL WAS DISRUPTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO COMPLETE THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT AS PLANNED OWING TO THE CANCELLATION OF GCSE EXAMS IN SUMMER 2020. THIS MEANT THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION WAS UNABLE TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMME. HOWEVER, THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS EVALUATION (IPE) WAS ABLE TO BE COMPLETED. THIS REPORTED SEVERAL PERCEIVED BENEFITS FOR MENTEES, MENTORS, AND TEACHERS.
MENTORS PERCEIVED THE MAIN BENEFITS TO THEMSELVES TO BE AN IMPROVED CV AND FEELING GOOD ABOUT HELPING OTHERS. THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE OF INCREASED INTEREST AMONGST MENTORS IN A TEACHING CAREER OR SUPPORTING DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE. MENTEES WERE GENERALLY HIGHLY ENGAGED IN THE PROGRAMME, AND THEIR ENGAGEMENT WAS SUPPORTED BY THE ONE-TO-ONE FORMAT AND THE ONUS ON THEM TO LEAD THE SESSION CONTENT. A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MENTORS AND MENTEES, AND A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE OF MENTORING, WERE SEEN TO BE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVING THE INTENDED OUTCOMES OF THE PROGRAMME.
WHILE THE EVALUATION WAS UNABLE TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT OF ASCENTS ON GCSE OUTCOMES, IT DOES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE INTERVENTION WAS WELL-RECEIVED BY TEACHERS, MENTORS, AND MENTEES, AND WAS IMPLEMENTED AS INTENDED.

OUR PROGRAMMES OF STUDY HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY DESIGNED AROUND THE OTHER COMMITMENTS OF OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE OFTEN WORKING OR BASED SOME DISTANCE FROM THE CITY OF LINCOLN. ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND THE STUDY SCHOOLS AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ANNUAL STUDENT CONFERENCE. PHD STUDENTS NEGOTIATE A PERSONAL TIMETABLE OF STUDY AND TUTORIALS WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISORS. WE THEREFORE WELCOME STUDENTS WHO WISH TO STUDY BOTH FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME IN LINCOLN OR BASED ELSEWHERE.
WE ARE UNDERTAKING RESEARCH IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION IN ORDER TO MAKE A POSITIVE, MEASURABLE, IMPACT UPON TEACHING AND LEARNING IN THOSE AREAS. SOME OF OUR CURRENT RESEARCH INVOLVES: LOOKING AT THE PROVISION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PSYCHO-EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS INVOLVING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP SUPPORT CARERS OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA; THE IMPACT OF OPEN DAYS AND OPEN EVENINGS ON KEY STAGE 2 STUDENTS; CULTURAL DIFFERENCES IN THE PREVALENCE OF MISCONCEPTIONS IN SCIENCE.
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MANY ASPECTS OF CONTEMPORARY LIFE AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MORE EFFECTIVE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT POSITIVELY BOTH ON INDIVIDUAL LIVES AND THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE.
WE SHARE THE VIEW THAT EDUCATIONAL PRACTICE IN ALL AREAS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NEEDS TO BE INFORMED BY OBJECTIVE, RESEARCH BASED, EVIDENCE RATHER THAN THE VIEWS AND PERSONAL OPINIONS OF THOSE WORKING IN THOSE AREAS.

THE ANNOUNCED STRIKES BY THE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE UNION (UCU) SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE FROM MONDAY 25 SEPTEMBER WILL NO LONGER GO AHEAD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN.
THE UCUS NATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE AGREED TO ALLOW INDIVIDUAL UNION BRANCHES TO REQUEST EXEMPTION FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE FIVE DAYS OF NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL ACTION.
AFTER CONSULTING ITS MEMBERS, THE LINCOLN UCU BRANCH REQUESTED AN EXEMPTION AND THIS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE NATIONAL UCU. THIS MEANS THAT NO STRIKES WILL TAKE PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN NEXT WEEK. STUDENTS WILL EXPERIENCE NO DISRUPTION ON CAMPUS OR TO THEIR LECTURES AND SHOULD ATTEND TIMETABLED ACTIVITIES AS NORMAL.
WE ARE GRATEFUL TO ALL COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO ENSURING A POSITIVE START TO THE NEW ACADEMIC YEAR FOR OUR NEW AND RETURNING STUDENTS.
THE FOLLOWING FAQS PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION AND STEPS BEING TAKEN TO SUPPORT STUDENTS.
 OFFER OF A 3% PAY UPLIFT FOR ALL STAFF AND 9% FOR STAFF ON LOWER SALARIES FOR 2022/23. THE UNION IS SEEKING A NATIONAL PAY SETTLEMENT OF 2% ABOVE THE CURRENT RATE OF INFLATION, OR 12%, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER. UNIVERSITIES SAY SUCH A PAY INCREASE IS UNAFFORDABLE FOR MANY INSTITUTIONS. LINCOLN, ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER UNIVERSITIES, IMPLEMENTED THE OFFERED PAY INCREASE SO ALL STAFF COULD BENEFIT FROM A PAY RISE AND SO BUDGETS COULD BE SET FOR THE CURRENT ACADEMIC YEAR. UCU MEMBERS ARE EXERCISING THEIR LAWFUL RIGHT TO TAKE INDUSTRIAL ACTION, FOLLOWING A BALLOT OF MEMBERS. YOU CAN READ MORE ABOUT THE DISPUTE ON THE UCU WEBSITE AND ON THE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYERS (UCEA) WEBSITE IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THE BACKGROUND.", 'STRIKE ACTION IS WHEN STAFF WITHDRAW THEIR LABOUR (REFUSE TO WORK) FOR A DEFINED PERIOD. AT UNIVERSITIES, THIS CAN INCLUDE REFUSING TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES SUCH AS TEACHING CLASSES, MARKING COURSEWORK, ATTENDING MEETINGS, SENDING EMAILS RELATED TO WORK, AND CARRYING OUT ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS ON THE SPECIFIED STRIKE DAYS. IT ALSO INCLUDES NOT PREPARING FOR WORK SCHEDULED AFTER THE STAFF MEMBER RETURNS FROM STRIKE.
WHEREAS STRIKE ACTION INVOLVES STAFF MEMBERS WITHDRAWING THEIR LABOUR ENTIRELY FOR A DEFINED PERIOD, ACTION SHORT OF STRIKE (ASOS) MEANS CONTINUING TO WORK BUT REFUSING TO DO SOME ACTIVITIES DEEMED TO BE OUTSIDE THE TERMS OF THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT. SOMETIMES THIS IS CALLED WORK TO RULE OR WORK TO CONTRACT. THE DEFINITION OF WORKING TO CONTRACT IS OPEN TO INTERPRETATION BUT MAY MEAN SOME ACADEMIC STAFF WILL NOT UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THEY CONSIDER OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTRACTED DUTIES, FOR EXAMPLE, BY ATTENDING OPEN DAYS.
NO. ABOUT A THIRD OF ACADEMIC STAFF AT LINCOLN ARE MEMBERS OF UCU AND SOME MAY CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRIKE ACTION.
UNION MEMBERS ARE NOT OBLIGED TO TELL THEIR EMPLOYER IN ADVANCE IF THEY INTEND TO TAKE PART IN STRIKES BUT SOME MAY CHOOSE TO DO SO. THE UNIVERSITY WILL BE FULLY OPEN ON THE DAYS OF THE STRIKES AND WE EXPECT MOST TIMETABLED SESSIONS WILL GO AHEAD AS SCHEDULED, SO WE ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO ATTEND UNIVERSITY AS PLANNED. THE UNIVERSITY WILL TRY TO INFORM YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IF YOUR TEACHING SESSION IS GOING TO BE AFFECTED BY STRIKE ACTION BUT THIS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE POSSIBLE IN ADVANCE. PLEASE DO BE PREPARED TO UNDERTAKE INDEPENDENT OR GROUP STUDY IF NECESSARY ON THE DAY. IF YOUR CLASS IS CANCELLED UNEXPECTEDLY, PLEASE LET US KNOW SO WE CAN ENSURE ALL STUDENTS ON YOUR MODULE ARE TREATED FAIRLY IN HOW WE COVER ANY MISSED LEARNING OUTCOMES OR IF WE NEED TO MAKE ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO ASSESSMENTS. YOU CAN USE THIS ONLINE FORM HTTPS://LNCN.AC/CLASSCANCEL TO NOTIFY US OF A SESSION WHICH HAS NOT GONE AHEAD.
THE UNIVERSITY IS PLANNING TO MINIMISE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE IMPACT OF THE UCU STRIKE ACTION ON TEACHING, LEARNING AND THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. WE WILL AIM WHEREVER WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL LEARNING OUTCOMES FROM CANCELLED TEACHING SESSIONS WILL BE COVERED ELSEWHERE, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY NOT BE THROUGH THE SAME STAFF MEMBER OR THE SAME SORT OF SESSION. WHERE THAT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE, WE WILL ADJUST ASSESSMENTS SO THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT WHICH COVERS TEACHING THAT WAS MISSED.
MOST UNIVERSITY SERVICES WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THE STRIKES. KEY SERVICES LIKE THE LIBRARY, CAREERS, WELLBEING SERVICE, STUDENT SUPPORT CENTRE AND CAFES WILL BE OPEN AS NORMAL. IT IS POSSIBLE SOME PERSONAL TUTOR APPOINTMENTS COULD BE AFFECTED BUT YOUR SCHOOL OFFICE WILL BE OPEN AND ABLE TO HELP YOU REARRANGE APPOINTMENTS.
 VIEWS, WHETHER OR NOT THEY SUPPORT THE STRIKES, AND TO PRESERVE OUR ONE COMMUNITY VALUES.", "UNIVERSITY PAY NEGOTIATIONS ARE CONDUCTED ANNUALLY AT A NATIONAL LEVEL BETWEEN THE MAIN HIGHER EDUCATION TRADE UNIONS (INCLUDING UCU) AND THE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYERS' ASSOCIATION (CALLED UCEA). UNIVERSITIES HAVE RAISED CONCERNS THAT UCU'S PAY DEMANDS FOR 2022/23 WOULD PUSH SOME LESS WEALTHY INSTITUTIONS INTO DEFICIT AND MIGHT MEAN SOME UNIVERSITIES WOULD NOT BE VIABLE. JUST AS INFLATION IS PUTTING A GREAT STRAIN ON INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES, UNIVERSITIES ARE ALSO FACING HIGHER COSTS, WHILE THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF FUNDING, UNDERGRADUATE TUITION FEES, HAS BEEN FROZEN SINCE 2017. THIS YEAR, THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS FORECASTING AN OPERATING SURPLUS OF JUST UNDER 2M - LESS THAN 1% OF OUR ANNUAL TURNOVER. EVERY EXTRA 1% IN PAY INCREASES FOR STAFF REQUIRES AN EXTRA 1M OF INCOME IN THE BUDGET TO COVER THE COST.", 'WHERE CLASSES ARE CANCELLED, OUR ATTENDANCE MONITORING SYSTEM WILL BE UPDATED TO CONFIRM THE CANCELLATION. THIS WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON YOUR PERCENTAGE ATTENDANCE REPORTS.
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MINIMISE THE IMPACT OF STRIKE ACTION ON TEACHING AND LEARNING THROUGH, AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, ARRANGING FOR ALL LEARNING OUTCOMES FROM CANCELLED SESSIONS TO BE COVERED ELSEWHERE (NOTING THIS MAY NOT BE DELIVERED BY THE SAME STAFF OR THE SAME SORT OF SESSION). IF IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO COVER ALL LEARNING OUTCOMES IN THIS WAY, WE WILL ADJUST ASSESSMENTS SO THAT YOU WILL NEVER BE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT WHICH COVERS TEACHING THAT WAS MISSED. TO ENSURE ALL STUDENTS ARE TREATED FAIRLY, ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO ASSESSMENTS WILL BE FOR ALL STUDENTS ON THAT AFFECTED MODULE. IF YOU HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECT OF THE INDUSTRIAL ACTION ON YOUR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OR ASSESSMENTS, PLEASE DO TALK TO YOUR PERSONAL TUTOR OR THE HEAD OF SCHOOL. YOUR SCHOOL REP MAY ALSO BE A GOOD PERSON TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH AS THEY CAN PASS ON YOUR CONCERNS TO THE SCHOOL ANONYMOUSLY.
IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU MAY HAVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING ON CAMPUS ON A DAY OF STRIKE ACTION WHEN ALL YOUR SCHEDULED TEACHING THAT DAY WAS CANCELLED WITH NO PRIOR WARNING, WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO HELP COVER THOSE COSTS. YOU WILL NEED TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF YOUR COSTS (WITH RECEIPTS IF POSSIBLE) OR DETAILS OF MILEAGE WHERE YOUR COSTS RELATE TO TRAVEL IN YOUR OWN CAR. YOU CAN DOWNLOAD OURREFUND FORM FOR TRAVEL COSTS. WE SUGGEST YOU SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE PLANNED PERIOD OF STRIKE ACTION BEFORE LETTING US KNOW ABOUT ANY COSTS YOU MAY HAVE INCURRED.
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW IF A SPECIFIC CLASS WILL TAKE PLACE, PLEASE ASK THE MEMBER OF STAFF DUE TO TEACH IT, BUT PLEASE REMEMBER STAFF DO NOT HAVE TO TELL YOU IF THEY INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN INDUSTRIAL ACTION.
IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF STRIKES ON YOUR STUDIES AS A WHOLE, YOU CAN CONTACT YOUR PERSONAL TUTOR FOR ADVICE AND REASSURANCE. IF YOUR PERSONAL TUTOR IS TAKING STRIKE ACTION YOU MAY PREFER TO CONTACT YOUR HEAD OF SCHOOL.
FOR INDEPENDENT AND CONFIDENTIAL ADVICE, YOU CAN CONTACT THE SU ADVICE SERVICE, YOUR STUDENT REP OR THE STUDENT SUPPORT CENTRE.
MORE INFORMATION AND CONTACT DETAILS FOR STUDENT SUPPORT TEAMS CAN BE FOUND ON THE STUDENT SERVICES MICROSITE AT HTTPS://STUDENTSERVICES.LINCOLN.AC.UK/.
WE WILL ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP YOU UPDATED AS DETAILS OF THE PLANNED ACTION ARE CONFIRMED. PLEASE CONTINUE TO CHECK YOUR UNIVERSITY EMAIL ACCOUNT AND THESE WEBSITE FAQS.
PLEASE ASSUME TIMETABLED TEACHING IS GOING AHEAD ON DAYS OF STRIKE ACTION UNLESS YOU ARE TOLD OTHERWISE IN ADVANCE. AUTHORISED ABSENCE WILL NOT BE APPROVED FOR STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE NOT TO ATTEND TIMETABLED TEACHING SESSIONS WHICH GO AHEAD ON STRIKE DAYS.
HEADS OF SCHOOL ARE MONITORING THE IMPACT OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION ON MODULES AND PROGRAMMES AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND IN CONSULTATION WITH ACADEMIC COLLEAGUES AND STUDENT REPRESENTATIVES. HEADS ARE SEEKING TO REDUCE THE IMPACT ON ALL STUDENTS BY MAKING SURE THAT LEARNING OUTCOMES ARE MET IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND MATERIALS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS FROM CANCELLED CLASSES. IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES THIS APPROACH WILL WORK; HOWEVER, THIS MAY NOT ALWAYS BE PRACTICABLE, IN WHICH CASE ONE (OR MORE) OF THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES WILL APPLY.

THE IN-SESSIONAL TEAM
AFTER TEACHING EFL, ESOL, AND EAP IN THREE COUNTRIES, I WENT BACK TO UNIVERSITY IN 2012. I STUDIED FOR AN MA IN TRANSLATION STUDIES THEN A PHD AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER. I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATION. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN STYLE AND HOW, THROUGH TRANSLATION, ONE COULD EITHER PRESERVE THE STYLE OF THE SOURCE TEXT OR MANIPULATE IT TO MAKE THE TARGET TEXT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDER READERSHIP. I COINED THE TERM EXOTERICISING TO DESCRIBE THIS PROCESS.
ORIGINATING FROM RURAL CAMBRIDGESHIRE, I ORIGINALLY STUDIED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND WORKED AS A PROGRAMMER BEFORE BECOMING AN ENGLISH TEACHER IN 2006. I HAVE SINCE TAUGHT IN MANY AMAZING COUNTRIES INCLUDING VIETNAM, COLOMBIA, TURKEY, AND MYANMAR. THROUGH TEACHING, I HAVE MET MANY WONDERFUL STUDENTS WHOSE PASSION FOR LEARNING AND MOTIVATION INSPIRE ME EVERY DAY. IN MY FREE TIME, I ENJOY RUNNING AND GOING ON LONG HIKES, HOPING TO DISCOVER WHAT IS AROUND THE NEXT CORNER AND THE FINDING THE WAY HOME.
WELCOME TO THE UK, TO LINCOLN, TO THE UNIVERSITY AND  LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST  TO THE INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE. HAVING LIVED AND WORKED ABROAD FOR MOST OF MY MARRIED LIFE, I KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE FAR FROM HOME, SO I REALLY ENJOY SUPPORTING OUR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU SOON! 
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND HAVE BEEN A MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE TEAM SINCE 2016. I HAVE TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING IN EDUCATION INTERNATIONALLY AND IN THE UK. IN THE PAST, I HAVE LIVED AND WORKED IN JAPAN, CHINA AND RUSSIA. AS LINCOLN IS MY HOMETOWN, I AM ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT HELPING STUDENTS EXPLORE THE CITY. 
IM FROM LINCOLN ORIGINALLY AND HAVE RECENTLY MOVED BACK HERE AFTER TEACHING ABROAD FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. THIS EXPERIENCE OF LIVING ABROAD HAS PROVIDED ME WITH A VALUABLE INSIGHT OF BEING IMMERSED IN A FOREIGN CULTURE. IM LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING OUR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE THEIR ACADEMIC ENGLISH SKILLS. IN TERMS OF MY OWN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE, I RECENTLY COMPLETED AN MA IN TESOL. AWAY FROM WORK, I ENJOY TRAVELLING AND ACTIVITIES IN NATURE. 
ORIGINALLY FROM THE NORTH OF ENGLAND, I STUDIED ENGLISH LITERATURE AT NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY. AFTER MY DOCTORATE, I WORKED AS A LECTURER IN ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, NOTTINGHAM TRENT UNIVERSITY, AND UNIVERSITY OF WORCESTER. I JOINED THE INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE IN 2022, FIRST AS A PRE-SESSIONAL ENGLISH AND ACADEMIC SKILLS TUTOR, THEN AS SENIOR TUTOR FOR EAP IN 2023. I LIKE READING, TENNIS, AND CHESS.
ORIGINALLY FROM WALES, IVE BEEN TEACHING FOR OVER 20 YEARS IN PLACES AS DIVERSE AS JAPAN, OMAN, SAUDI ARABIA AND THE LAKE DISTRICT! STUDYING WORLD LITERATURE FOR BA, AND TEACHING BOTH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE, I CHANGED DIRECTION FOR MY MA IN APPLIED LINGUISTICS. I BELIEVE IN LIFELONG LEARNING, DOING WHAT ENTHUSES YOU AND EMBRACING NEW EXPERIENCES. I LOVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH AGATHA CHRISTIE AND ENJOY THE WATER: RENOVATING, DRIVING AND SAILING BOATS.

THE PRE-SESSIONAL TEAM
I AM ORIGINALLY FROM A SMALL VILLAGE IN LINCOLNSHIRE BUT HAVE SPENT MUCH OF MY TEACHING CAREER IN LARGE CITIES AROUND THE WORLD IN THAILAND, MEXICO, CHINA AND BEYOND! MY EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND IS IN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION, SO I REALLY ENJOY MEETING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR ACADEMIC CAREERS. I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN SYLLABUS AND ASSESSMENT DESIGN AS WELL AS EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND QUALITY ASSURANCE: I LIKE TO KNOW THAT OUR COURSES ARE BENEFITTING OUR STUDENTS!
I AM FROM THE MIDLANDS AND ATTENDED THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK (DPHIL, 1995). WORKING IN GLOBAL RESEARCH GROUPS SPARKED MY INTEREST IN ASSISTING NON-NATIVE ENGLISH-SPEAKING ACADEMICS, ULTIMATELY LEADING ME TO LINCOLN IN 2014. I HAVE SUPPORTED VARIOUS LEARNER PROFILES  FROM UNDERGRADUATES TO VICE CHANCELLORS  DESIGNING STRATEGIES FOR BOOSTING THEIR WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATION SKILLS. IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO CONTINUE THIS WORK BY GUIDING STUDENTS ABOUT TO BEGIN THEIR UNIVERSITY LIFE AT LINCOLN.
IM ORIGINALLY FROM IRELAND AND FIRST CAME TO WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IN 2013. MY BACKGROUND IS IN LANGUAGES, LINGUISTICS AND TRANSLATION. I SPEAK SPANISH, FRENCH AND PORTUGUESE, SO I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LEARN ANOTHER LANGUAGE TO AN ADVANCED LEVEL. IT CAN BE CHALLENGING, BUT ALSO VERY REWARDING. I LOVE LANGUAGES BECAUSE THEY OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW WAY OF SEEING THE WORLD. I FEEL PRIVILEGED TO PLAY A PART IN SUPPORTING INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THEIR OWN JOURNEY AT UNIVERSITY.

AS A CANADIAN IN THE UK, I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LIVE IN ANOTHER CULTURE.

OUTSIDE OF LANGUAGES, I LOVE SPENDING TIME OUTDOORS. I ENJOY CAMPING, HIKING, BIKING, AND KAYAKING; ENGLAND HAS SO MANY GREAT PLACES TO EXPLORE. WHEN THE WEATHER IS POOR, ILL BE AT HOME CROCHETING AND TRYING TO GET MY CAT TO STOP PLAYING WITH YARN.
BORN AND RAISED IN LINCOLN, I HAVE WORKED IN SEVERAL TEAMS DURING MY TIME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, CONTINUING TO EXPAND MY KNOWLEDGE OF THE UNIVERSITY AS A WHOLE. I HOPE THAT THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE GAINED CAN BENEFIT BOTH THE INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE TEAM AND THE STUDENTS.

FINANCIAL POSITION | ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNFINANCIAL POSITION
WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN AWARDED TRIPLE GOLD STATUS IN THE LATEST TEACHING EXCELLENCE FRAMEWORK (TEF) 2023 AND TO WIN THE QUEENS ANNIVERSARY PRIZE 2023  THE HIGHEST NATIONAL HONOUR FOR UK UNIVERSITIES.
THESE LATEST ACCOLADES RECOGNISE THE QUALITY OF OUR TEACHING AND RESEARCH, AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT THIS HAS ON THE LIVES OF OUR STUDENTS, OUR REGION, AND THE BUSINESSES AND RESEARCH PARTNERS WE WORK WITH EVERY DAY.
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, LIKE UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE UK, IS RESPONDING TO GROWING FINANCIAL PRESSURES FACING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR. THIS PAGE EXPLAINS MORE ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THESE PRESSURES AND THE STEPS WE ARE TAKING TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.
DUE TO THE CHANGING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SITUATION, WE WILL UPDATE THIS PAGE AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS NOT IN FINANCIAL DEFICIT. WE RETURNED A SURPLUS IN THE LAST FINANCIAL YEAR (2022/23) AND GREW OUR REVENUES. WE HAVE RETURNED SURPLUSES EVERY YEAR, BAR ONE (DURING THE COVID PANDEMIC), FOR MORE THAN A DECADE.
AS A CHARITY, ANY SURPLUS WE MAKE IS INVESTED BACK INTO THE UNIVERSITY. WE HAVE AMPLE LIQUIDITY (CASH) TO SATISFY BANKS AND REGULATORS.HOWEVER, THE ONGOING FREEZE IN TUITION FEES COMBINED WITH VOLATILE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT DEMAND AND HIGH INFLATION MEANS OUR COSTS ARE NOW RISING FASTER THAN OUR INCOME  A FAMILIAR PICTURE FOR UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
TO ENSURE WE ARE WELL-PLACED TO RESPOND TO THESE ECONOMIC HEADWINDS, WE ARE TAKING PRACTICAL STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURE. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE A FINANCIAL BREAKEVEN POSITION IN 2023/24 (THE UNIVERSITY FINANCIAL YEAR RUNS FROM AUGUST TO ALIGN WITH THE ACADEMIC YEAR).
THE 2024/25 ACADEMIC YEAR POSES GREATER CHALLENGES FOR UNIVERSITIES TO BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS.
ON AVERAGE, UNIVERSITIES NOW LOSE MONEY ON TEACHING UK UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AND UNDERTAKING GOVERNMENT-FUNDED RESEARCH. THEY INCREASINGLY RELY ON OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME TO STAY SUSTAINABLE, THE MAIN SOURCE BEING ENROLMENTS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO PAY HIGHER TUITION FEES.
THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS UNIVERSITIES EXPECT TO ENROL IN 2024/25 IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO RECENT GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN IMMIGRATION POLICY. CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT INTERNATIONAL ENROLMENTS IN 2024/25 WILL BE HIGHER THAN 2023/24. SOME UNIVERSITIES ARE FORECASTING SIGNIFICANT DROPS. MEANWHILE, COSTS ARE GOING UP, FROM ENERGY BILLS TO EMPLOYER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.
FOR MORE ON THE FINANCIAL PRESSURES FACING UK UNIVERSITIES, SEE THE UNIVERSITIES UK AND PWC REPORT, FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THE UK HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR (JANUARY 2024).
FIT FOR THE FUTURE
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS A UNIVERSITY OF, AND FOR, THE 21ST CENTURY. THE BENEFITS WE BRING TO OUR STUDENTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO LET EXTERNAL PRESSURES OVERTAKE US.
OUR STRATEGY STATES THE AMBITION TO BE A UK TOP 40 UNIVERSITY BY 2027. THIS VISION REMAINS VALID AND ACHIEVABLE, AND OUR SENSE OF PURPOSE REMAINS AS IMPORTANT AS EVER: TO TRANSFORM LIVES AND COMMUNITIES.
WE HAVE BEEN MEETING THE NEEDS AND ASPIRATIONS OF OUR REGION FOR DECADES. OUR FOCUS NOW IS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE THE RIGHT SHAPE AND SIZE TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND SUCCESSFUL: TO BE FIT FOR THE FUTURE.
THE UNIVERSITY IS TAKING A SERIES OF STEPS TO REDUCE OUR EXPENDITURE IN 2024/25.
THIS INCLUDES REDUCING NON-PAY BUDGETS, LOWERING MANAGEMENT COSTS, AND STREAMLINING DEPARTMENTAL STRUCTURES, AS WELL AS GROWING OTHER SOURCES OF INCOME.REGRETTABLY, GIVEN STAFF SALARIES ARE OUR BIGGEST AREA OF EXPENDITURE, IT WILL ALSO MEAN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE EMPLOY.
MINIMISING JOB LOSSES, SUPPORTING OUR STAFF, AND PROTECTING THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE WILL BE ABSOLUTE PRIORITIES.INFORMATION ON WHAT THIS MEANS FOR STAFF CAN BE FOUND ON THE UNIVERSITY'S INTRANET.
WE ARE FORTUNATE TO BE IN A STABLE FINANCIAL POSITION, HAVING RETURNED MODEST SURPLUSES IN RECENT YEARS. THIS IS NOT THE NORM: AROUND 1 IN 4 UK UNIVERSITIES WERE IN DEFICIT IN 2021/22 AND 40% OF UNIVERSITIES ARE FORECASTING A DEFICIT IN 2023/24. SOME UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN IN DEFICIT FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS OR MORE. AS WE LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION, IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW, OR WHEN, THE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT MARKET WILL RETURN TO THE LEVELS WE SAW IN 2022/23. THERE IS ALSO NO SIGN OF AN IMMINENT INCREASE IN TUITION FEES AND OTHER INCOME FROM STUDENTS IS CONSTRAINED BY THE NEED TO ENSURE THE UNIVERSITY REMAINS AFFORDABLE TO ALL. WE MUST, THEREFORE, TAKE IMMEDIATE AND PRAGMATIC STEPS TO REDUCE OUR COSTS AND INCREASE INCOME FROM OTHER SOURCES. TAKING ACTION NOW WILL ENSURE THE UNIVERSITY CONTINUES TO THRIVE AND SERVE ITS STUDENTS AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY.
MOST UNIVERSITIES MAIN SOURCE OF INCOME  THE HOME UNDERGRADUATE TUITION FEE  HAS BEEN FROZEN BY THE UK GOVERNMENT AT 9,250 SINCE 2017 AND WILL NOT BE INCREASED UNTIL AT LEAST 2025. HIGH INFLATION IN RECENT YEARS MEANS THE FEE IS NOW WORTH ABOUT TWO THIRDS IN REAL TERMS COMPARED TO A DECADE AGO.
 ON AVERAGE, UNIVERSITIES NOW LOSE MONEY ON MOST UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING (ALTHOUGH THIS VARIES AT SUBJECT AND INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL). UNTIL RECENTLY, UNIVERSITIES HAVE PARTIALLY COVERED THE COST OF THESE LOSS-MAKING ACTIVITIES WITH THE HIGHER FEES PAID BY INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS BUT CHANGES TO IMMIGRATION POLICIES HAVE SEEN A SUDDEN DECLINE IN THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE UK AS A STUDY DESTINATION. THE FIRST IMPACTS WERE FELT IN SEPTEMBER 2023 AND ARE NOW BEING REPEATED FOR JANUARY/FEBRUARY 2024 INTAKES ACROSS THE SECTOR.
UNIVERSITIES UK (UUK) AND VARIOUS OTHER SECTOR BODIES HAVE MADE THE CASE TO GOVERNMENT THAT THE UK HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING SYSTEM IS NO LONGER SUSTAINABLE. A REPORT WAS RELEASED BY PWC, COMMISSIONED BY UUK, IN JANUARY 2024 MAKING IT CLEAR TO GOVERNMENT THE CHALLENGES FACING THE SECTOR, TITLED FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY OF UK UNIVERSITIES: PWC FINDINGS.

THE CLINIC IS VERY MUCH A STUDENT CENTRED PROJECT. EACH YEAR ABOUT 60 LAW STUDENTS BECOME MEMBERS OF THE CLINIC. THE STUDENTS ARE DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT FIRMS USUALLY CONSISTING OF A THIRD YEAR STUDENT AS THE HEAD OF FIRM AND 6 OTHER STUDENTS.
STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF PREPARING FOR AND CONDUCTING CLIENT INTERVIEWS. STUDENTS PARTICIPATE IN PRE AND POST INTERVIEW MEETINGS WITH CLINIC STAFF AND DISCUSS THE ISSUES WHICH MAY ARISE OR HAVE ARISEN DURING THE COURSE OF THE INTERVIEW. STUDENTS THEN CARRY OUT POST INTERVIEW RESEARCH ON THE PARTICULAR LEGAL ISSUE OR ISSUES CONCERNED AND PREPARE A LETTER OF ADVICE TO BE ISSUED TO THE CLIENT.
FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE CLINIC, STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP SKILLS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE DEVELOPED UNTIL MUCH LATER ON IN THEIR LEGAL CAREERS. AT THE INTERVIEW STAGE STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR COMMUNICATION SKILLS, THEIR INTERVIEWING SKILLS AND THEIR NOTE TAKING SKILLS.
POST INTERVIEW, STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP THEIR TEAM WORKING SKILLS, THEIR RESEARCH SKILLS AND LETTER WRITING SKILLS. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS STUDENTS ARE MADE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIENT CARE AND MANAGING THE EXPECTATIONS OF NOT ONLY THEIR CLIENT BUT ALSO THOSE OF THEIR OTHER FIRM MEMBERS AND CLINIC STAFF.

SHE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE, EMPIRICAL STUDY INTO OFFENDERS EXPERIENCES OF GRIEF AND THE ACCESSIBILITY OF SUPPORT SERVICES FOR RELIGIOUS AND NON-RELIGIOUS PRISONERS, ANALYSED THROUGH THE LENS OF THE EQUALITY ACT 2010.
HER PHD WAS AWARDED IN 2020, AND HER RESEARCH FINDINGS WERE PUBLISHED IN BEREAVEMENT BEHIND BARS: PRISON AND THE GRIEVING PROCESS (PRISON SERVICE JOURNAL, 2021) AND NON-RELIGIOUS PRISONERS UNEQUAL ACCESS TO PASTORAL CARE (INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LAW IN CONTEXT, 2022). THE FULL THESIS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE BRITISH LIBRARY ETHOS.
JUST GET ON WITH IT: A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF PRISON OPERATIONAL MANAGERS AND GOVERNOR GRADES
IN 2021, A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN WORKED WITH THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION TO EVALUATE THE STATE OF THEIR MEMBERS HEALTH AND WELLBEING, WITH THIS BEING PARTICULARLY PERTINENT FOLLOWING THE IMMENSE PRESSURE EXPERIENCED DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
BASED ON SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 63 PRISON OPERATIONAL MANAGERS AND GOVERNOR GRADES, THE KEY THEMES OF THE RESEARCH INCLUDE NOT FEELING VALUED, IMPACT ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FRUSTRATION OVER LACK OF AUTONOMY AND FEARS FOR THE FUTURE; ALL OF WHICH HAVE LED SOME TO FOLLOW A PATH TO DISENCHANTMENT. A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH CAN BE VIEWED AT: HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=LFRX3IMATPM.
THE PROJECT TEAM INCLUDED DR LAUREN SMITH, RACHAEL MASON, PROFESSOR KAREN HARRISON, DR HELEN NICHOLS (UNIVERSITY OF HULL), DR GARY SAUNDERS (UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM), AND DR LAUREN HALL.
S DOCTORAL RESEARCH LOOKED AT HOW CONFIDENCE AND LEGITIMACY WERE MAINTAINED THROUGH THE PROCESSES OF NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING. THE STUDY, CARRIED OUT IN A SINGLE LONDON BOROUGH, FOUND THAT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO DELIVER CONFIDENCE WERE STILL VALUED, BUT PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO BUDGET CUTS. THE LONDON SYSTEM OF WARD PANELS COULD SUPPORT NEIGHBOURHOOD POLICING IN UNEXPECTED (ALTHOUGH NOT ENTIRELY UNPROBLEMATIC) WAYS.", 'HER RESEARCH CONCLUDED THAT LEGITIMACY AND CONFIDENCE ARE LOCALLY AND SITUATIONALLY CONTINGENT, AS ARE IDEAS OF FAIRNESS AND OTHER VALUES; MEANING THAT EFFECTIVE POLICING MUST ALSO INCLUDE A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN ELEMENT; IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO DECIDE WHAT IT IS THAT POLICING SHOULD ACHIEVE AND THEN HOPE THAT CONFIDENCE AND LEGITIMACY WILL FOLLOW. FINDINGS WERE PUBLISHED IN DOING THE RIGHT THING? VALUE CONFLICTS AND COMMUNITY POLICING (POLICING AND SOCIETY, 2022).
DR LAUREN SMITH, PROFESSOR AMANDA ROBERTS AND STEVE SHARMAN (KINGS COLLEGE LONDON) COMPLETED RESEARCH IN A CATEGORY B MALE PRISON TO EXPLORE THE PREVALENCE AND NATURE OF GAMBLING IN THE PRISON. KEY FINDINGS INCLUDED 45 PER CENT OF PEOPLE REPORTING GAMBLING IN PRISON, WITH 30 PER CENT REPORTING THAT GAMBLING WAS A NORMAL PART OF PRISON LIFE.
PRE-PRISON BEHAVIOUR, WHETHER TYPE OF INDEX OFFENCE OR PRIOR GAMBLING, HAD LITTLE RELATIONSHIP TO IN-PRISON GAMBLING. FREQUENCY OF GAMBLING IN PRISON INCREASED WITH INCREASING GAMBLING RISK CATEGORY, AS INDICATED BY THE PROBLEM GAMBLING SEVERITY INDEX (PGSI). THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF GAMBLING IN PRISON WERE CARD/DICE GAMES, SPORTS, AND BALL GAMES, WHILE THE MOST COMMON MOTIVES WERE ENTERTAINMENT, EXCITEMENT, OR SENSE OF CHALLENGE AND TO WIN PRIZES, WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MOTIVE BETWEEN PGSI RISK CATEGORIES. PRISON CANTEEN ITEMS FORMED THE MOST COMMON CURRENCY GAMBLED. PEOPLE WITHIN THE HIGHER PGSI RISK CATEGORY WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BORROWED ITEMS FROM OTHER PRISONERS.

SURVIVING, NOT LIVING: THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF CRIME AND GAMBLING
COMMISSIONED BY THE COMMISSION ON CRIME AND GAMBLING RELATED HARMS, LED BY LORD GOLDSMITH QC, AND PUBLISHED BY THE HOWARD LEAGUE, THE RESEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT BY DR LAUREN SMITH. THE REPORT PROVIDES DETAILED ACCOUNTS FROM 22 PEOPLE WHO HAD EXPERIENCED GAMBLING-RELATED HARMS AND WHO HAVE EITHER HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM OR HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY IT AS A FAMILY MEMBER. THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTED A LACK OF AWARENESS AND SUPPORT THROUGHOUT ALL STAGES OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
THE REPORT IS THE SECOND MAJOR PROJECT COMMISSIONED AND FORMS PART OF A FINAL REPORT DUE TO BE LAUNCHED IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS SHORTLY. THE REPORT CAN BE ACCESSED HERE: HTTPS://HOWARDLEAGUE.ORG/PUBLICATIONS/SURVIVING-NOT-LIVING-LIVED-EXPERIENCES-OF-CRIME-AND-GAMBLING/.
WHILE THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT MOST OFFICERS THOUGHT THAT THE INCLUSION OF BWV WAS POSITIVE CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT ISSUES PRIVACY INFRINGEMENT AND THE USE OF BWV FOOTAGE AS A POTENTIAL TOOL FOR SUPERVISORY SURVEILLANCE. A NUMBER OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF USING BWV WERE ALSO NOTED.

THE POLICING NETWORK
THE POLICING NETWORK IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AND LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE. IT WAS LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2021 AND HAS THE FOLLOWING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES:
1. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF POLICING WHICH REQUIRE CHALLENGE-LED RESEARCH.
2. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE TO MAKE APPLICATIONS FOR FUNDING.
3. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND WITH LINCOLNSHIRE POLICE TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH WITH IMPACT.
THE NETWORK CURRENTLY HOSTS FOUR GROUPS (HEALTH AND WELLBEING, COMMUNITIES, DIGITAL POLICING, AND REDUCING REOFFENDING AND MENTAL HEALTH).
LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITHIN INTEGRATED OFFENDER MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED OFFENDER MANAGEMENT (IOM) IS A PARTNERSHIP APPROACH TO REDUCING OFFENDING WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT TO, AND MANAGEMENT OF, PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS BEING ENGAGED IN OFFENDING BEHAVIOUR WHICH CAUSES DAMAGE AND HARM WITHIN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. UNDER THE RELAUNCH OF IOM IN LINCOLNSHIRE, A NEW COHORT OF PEOPLE AGED 18-25 HAS BEEN ADOPTED AND A SCORING TOOL IMPLEMENTED TO DETERMINE ACCEPTANCE INTO THE COHORT. THIS RESEARCH IS AN INITIAL STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND EXPERIENCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WITHIN THE IOM COHORT THAT WOULD SUBSEQUENTLY INFORM FURTHER RESEARCH IN THE AREA.
AUTOMATING POLICING FUNCTIONS: THIS INVOLVES TWO PROJECTS, WHICH ARE BASED AROUND AUTOMATING SOME BACKEND FUNCTIONS TO FREE UP OFFICERS AND STAFF TIME SPENT ON ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS. THE TWO PROJECTS ARE: (1) AUTOMATING THE VICTIMS SURVEY; (2) AUTOMATING HOW CRIMES ARE REPORTED, AND HOW ONLINE REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION ARE DEALT WITH. AS PART OF THIS, THE TEAM WILL ALSO EVALUATE THE IMPACT THAT THIS AUTOMATION HAS HAD ON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND THE TIME AND MONEY THAT SUCH AUTOMATION HAS SAVED.

MEASURING AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE FOR PEOPLE ON PROBATION: DEVELOPING DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY INDICATORS
THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE NIHR RFPB PROGRAMME (GRANT REFERENCE NUMBER NIHR201091) AND LED BY DR CORAL SIRDIFIELD. IT AIMS TO:
A) IMPROVE THE MEASUREMENT, UNDERSTANDING AND RECORDING OF THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE NEEDS OF PEOPLE UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION BY INTRODUCING A RESEARCH-INFORMED WAY OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLES HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE NEEDS IF THEY HAVE BEEN MET. THIS WILL PROVIDE AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF NEEDS, AND WHERE THERE MAY BE GAPS IN SERVICE PROVISION TO MEET THEM.
B) DEVELOP QUALITY INDICATORS TO SUPPORT HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AMONGST PEOPLE ON PROBATION AND TO MEASURE AND MONITOR THE QUALITY OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE THAT PEOPLE ON PROBATION RECEIVE. THIS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES ARE COMMISSIONED FROM AN EVIDENCE-BASE, AND PROBATION STAFF CAN SUPPORT ACCESS WHEN NEEDED.
FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT CAN BE FOUND ATHTTPS://PROBATIONHEALTH.BLOGS.LINCOLN.AC.UK/.
DR LAUREN SMITH AND RACHAEL MASON FROM THE LCCJ ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AN EVALUATION OF THE WHOLE PRISON APPROACH ADOPTED BY HMP LINCOLN TO ADDRESS GAMBLING-RELATED HARMS AMONGST PRISONERS. THE PRISON HAS IMPLEMENTED STAFF TRAINING, TRAINING FOR PEERS AND SPECIFIC SCREENING FOR GAMBLING BEHAVIOURS, AND HAVE DEVELOPED CLEAR PATHWAYS INTO SPECIALIST SUPPORT FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING GAMBLING-RELATED HARMS, AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE EVALUATION WILL COMPRISE A MIXED METHODS APPROACH INCLUDING STAFF QUESTIONNAIRES, FOCUS GROUPS WITH PEOPLE IN PRISON, AND FOLLOW UP INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SUPPORT. THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ETHICS REVIEW AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED TOWARDS THE END OF 2024.
THE ROLE OF CANTEENS AND SHARED SPACES IN POLICE WELLBEING
DR CARINA OREILLY IS WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES FROM LIVERPOOL JOHN MOORES, THE OPEN UNIVERSITY, AND THE POLICE FEDERATION TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF CANTEENS AND SHARED SPACES IN POLICE WELLBEING. SEVERE CUTS TO POLICE BUDGETS IN THE LAST 12 YEARS HAVE SEEN THE SALE OF MUCH OF THE POLICE ESTATE, A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF POLICE STATIONS, AND THE REDESIGN OF INTERNAL SPACES ACCORDINGLY. THIS HAS REPORTEDLY LED TO A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN THE NUMBER OF CANTEENS AND REST AREAS PROVIDED FOR POLICE OFFICERS AND STAFF.
CANTEENS HAVE A SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE IN POLICING, WITH ACADEMIC DEBATES OVER THEIR ROLE IN REINFORCING POLICE CULTURE. HOWEVER, SOME SCHOLARS HAVE UNDERLINED THE IMPORTANCE OF CANTEENS AND SIMILAR SPACES TO OFFICERS WHO ENCOUNTER TRAUMATIC EVENTS, OFTEN ON A DAILY BASIS, AND WHO OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO SPEAK OPENLY TO NON-OFFICERS ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. THE LOSS OF CANTEENS AND OTHER SPACES THEREFORE MAY HAVE A SERIOUS DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON POLICE WELLBEING.
DR KATIE HUNT IS CURRENTLY RESEARCHING ORAL RAPE LAW REFORM, CRITIQUING THE SEXUAL OFFENCES ACT 2003 AND EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE STATUTORY APPROACHES TO ASSAULTS INVOLVING NON-CONSENSUAL ORAL PENETRATION. SHE IS ENGAGING WITH ABOLITIONIST THEORY TO EVALUATE CRIMINALISATION AS A RESPONSE TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE, AND THE CAPACITY OF LAW REFORM TO MEET FEMINIST AIMS GENERALLY.
PROFESSOR KAREN HARRISON, DR LAUREN SMITH AND DR CHLOE WILSON ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE PRISON GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION TO EXPLORE THE EDI EXPERIENCES OF PRISON GOVERNORS AND OPERATIONAL MANAGERS WORKING IN THE UK. THE PROJECT HAS FOUR KEY OBJECTIVES:
2. TO EXPLORE WITH PARTICIPANTS WHETHER THEY FACE DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THE PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS DEFINED IN THE EQUALITY ACT 2010.
3. TO ASSESS TO WHAT EXTENT PARTICIPANTS, FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG OR ARE INCLUDED AT WORK.
4. IF STAFF FEEL EXCLUDED, TO CONSIDER WHAT THE BARRIERS TO INCLUSION ARE AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO EFFECT POSITIVE CHANGE.
LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE | RESEARCH | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN"ACT AS IF THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE, BECAUSE IT IS."
THESE WORDS OF SWEDISH ACTIVIST, GRETA THUNBERG, SUM UP THE DAMAGE THAT HUMANS ARE WREAKING ON THE ENVIRONMENT. THEY ALSO SERVE AS A REMINDER THAT WE URGENTLY NEED TO EMBED NEW, OR BETTER WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT IN INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PRACTICES IF WE ARE TO PREVENT CRITICAL PLANETARY BOUNDARIES FROM BEING BREACHED. OUR FAILURE TO THINK AND TO ACT WILL RESULT IN CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS FOR HUMAN AND NATURAL SYSTEMS.
DESPITE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL ACHIEVEMENTS, WE REMAIN (AND WILL ALWAYS REMAIN) CRITICALLY DEPENDENT ON HEALTHY, FUNCTIONING EARTH-SYSTEM AND ECOSYSTEM PROCESSES. THE ACCELERATING ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION PROJECTED FOR THIS CENTURY, OF WHICH CLIMATE CHANGE, NATURAL HABITAT LOSS, OVER-EXPLOITATION OF RESOURCES AND POLLUTION ARE MAJOR DRIVERS, WILL LIKELY MOVE MANY KEY NATURAL SYSTEMS BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY FOR RESILIENCE TO THE LIMITS WHERE SUDDEN AND DRAMATIC REGIME SHIFTS, PERHAPS EVEN COMPLETE SYSTEM COLLAPSES, WILL OCCUR.
THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE CHANGES ARE PROFOUND, BOTH FOR THE NATURAL WORLD AND FOR THE GOODS AND SERVICES IT PROVIDES HUMANITY, NOT LEAST THE IMPACTS ON FOOD PRODUCTION AND THREATS TO HEALTH FROM POLLUTION AND EMERGING DISEASES. THEY ARE ALSO PROFOUND IN TERMS OF THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTION AND DISLOCATION THAT WILL INEVITABLY FOLLOW THESE CHANGES.
WE KNOW THAT SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. HOWEVER, OUR SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS CURRENTLY REMAIN EMBEDDED WITHIN INSTITUTIONS THAT PERPETUATE THE PROBLEM. IF WE ARE TO CHANGE THE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE ADOPTED WE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW BEST TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES IN HUMAN AND INSTITUTIONAL BEHAVIOUR AT A LEVEL AND DEGREE THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. DEVELOPING OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO INDUCE THE NECESSARY CHANGES REQUIRES NEW FORMS OF RESEARCH, WITH NEW SYNERGIES FROM INTERDISCIPLINARY, CROSS-SCALE RESEARCH IN LAW, THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, AND THE HUMANITIES.
THE LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE (LINCEJ) WILL LEAD AND ENABLE CREATIVE RESEARCH THAT DOES JUST THAT, AND WILL DELIVER NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE TYPES OF CHANGES AND GOVERNANCE MEASURES NEEDED TO TURN THE ANTHROPOCENE FROM AN ERA OF HIGH RISK FOR SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT TO ONE IN WHICH THE NEEDS OF ALL ARE MET ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS.
THROUGH OUR WORK ON PORTRAYING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE WE INTERROGATE THE REPRESENTATION OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE IN SOCIETY AND ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINES FROM THE ARTS TO THE NATURAL SCIENCES.
OUR RESEARCH GENERATES INSIGHTS INTO THE CAUSES AND IMPACTS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE ON SPECIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS.

PHD TOPIC:ACCELERATING SUSTAINABLE HOUSING CONSIDERING OCCUPANTS HEALTH, WELLBEING AND THERMAL COMFORT, THE CASE OF PALESTINE
ENERGY SECURITY AND AFFORDABILITY ARE AMONG THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING THE PALESTINIANS. WHILE THE HOUSING SECTOR IS A MAIN ENERGY CONSUMER, THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSING IS OF LOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY. BEFORE INTRODUCING THE RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES, OPTIMIZING THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IS CRUCIAL. MEANWHILE, VERY LIMITED RESEARCH INCORPORATES THE USERS BEHAVIOUR ALONGSIDE THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE BUILDINGS WHEN EXAMINING THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY. THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUSTAINABLE HOUSING IN PALESTINE WHILE CONSIDERING THERMAL COMFORT, WELLBEING AND HEALTH OF THE USERS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS RESEARCH WERE TO NARROW THE KNOWLEDGE GAP CONCERNING THE THERMAL PERFORMANCE OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND THE THERMAL BEHAVIOUR OF THE OCCUPANTS. ANOTHER GOAL WAS TO DEVELOP METHODS FOR ESTIMATING THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN BUILDINGS BY INTEGRATING THE SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OCCUPANTS. IN ADDITION TO CRITICALLY ASSESS THE LEVEL OF THERMAL COMFORT OF OCCUPANTS AND DEVELOP ADAPTIVE MODELS TO PREDICT THE LEVEL OF THERMAL COMFORT BASED ON THAT. FINALLY, TO CREATE VALIDATED DYNAMIC BUILDING ENERGY SIMULATION (DBES) MODELS FOR EXISTING CASE STUDY BUILDINGS AND INTEGRATE THE USERS ACTUAL BEHAVIOUR AND THERMAL COMFORT PREFERENCES IN THE SIMULATION TO OPTIMIZE THE USE OF ENERGY.
PHD TOPIC: DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION IN ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE: THE INTEGRATION OF COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION PRACTICES IN MINING COMMUNITIES IN GHANA
THIS THESIS IS ANCHORED ON THREE MAIN SUB-THEMES. IT INCLUDES DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION, COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOVERNANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF PARTICIPATION PRACTICES (E.G., CONSENSUS CONFERENCES, CITIZENS JURIES, DELIBERATIVE FORUMS) TO ELICIT COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL DECISION MAKING, WITH A FOCUS ON SELECTED MINING COMMUNITIES IN GHANA.
PHD TOPIC: THE PARTICIPATION OF NON-STATE ACTORS IN INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGIMES GOVERNING MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES
MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE NATURE OF PARTICIPATION OF NON-STATE ACTORS (E.G. INTERGOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS) IN REGIMES REGULATING THE UTILISATION OF MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES (I.E. DNA OF MARINE SPECIES). THE PARTICIPATION OF NON-STATE ACTORS IN THOSE REGIMES IS EXAMINED IN THE CONTEXT OF ENSURING EQUITY OF ACCESS TO BENEFITS OF UTILISING MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES.
PHD TOPIC: ACHIEVING THE RIGHT TO WATER IN SOUTH AFRICA (SA): A SOCIO-LEGAL STUDY ON THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT AGENCIES (CMAS) IN FOSTERING DECENTRALISED WATER GOVERNANCE
THE STUDY HAS BEEN MOTIVATED BY THE PROVISION OF A RIGHT TO WATER AS A BASIC RIGHT THROUGH S.27 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA, 108 OF 1996 AND THE NATIONAL WATER ACT (NWA), 36 OF 1998. THE HYPOTHESIS FOR THE STUDY IS THAT CMAS IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CONTEXT HAVE A POTENTIAL TO ACHIEVE A DECENTRALISED WATER GOVERNANCE THAT CAN HELP IN THE REALISATION OF S.27 OF THE CONSTITUTION (THE RIGHT TO WATER). THE STUDY EMPLOYS A SOCIO-LEGAL APPROACH TO CONTEXTUALISE UNDERSTANDING OF LAW IN PRACTICE AND IS SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL DATA COLLECTED FROM WATER EXPERTS AND MANAGERS WHO ADD THEIR VOICES TO THE APPRAISAL OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK.

UNDERSTANDING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE | LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNOUR UNDERSTANDING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE PROJECTS INVESTIGATE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THE NATURE OF JUSTICE IN ECOSYSTEMS, THE NATURE OF JUSTICE BETWEEN HUMANS AND THE ECOSYSTEMS OF WHICH THEY ARE PART, AND BETWEEN HUMANS PER SE. IN PARTICULAR, OUR RESEARCH GENERATES INSIGHTS INTO THE CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE ON SPECIES, SOCIETY AND GROUPS WITHIN SOCIETY, AND DEVELOPS NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE (IN)JUSTICE THESE IMPACTS RAISE. OUR RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE IMPLICATIONS ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE HAS FOR THE ORIGINS OF CORE CONCEPTS IN DISCIPLINES AS VARIED AS ARCHITECTURE, ECOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, LAW, AND PHOTOGRAPHY.
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF UNDERSTANDING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE WE INVESTIGATE TWO MAIN AREAS:
- THE NATURE OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE BETWEEN HUMANS 
- THE NATURE OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE WITHIN ECOSYSTEMS
EARTH-SYSTEMS LAW- THIS PROJECT LED BY PROFESSOR LOUIS KOTZ ADDRESSES THE (RE)DESIGN OF LAW TO ENSURE RESPECT FOR ALL LIFE ON EARTH.
ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE AT SEA -THIS PROJECT LED BY PROFESSORS BARNES AND KIRK IS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP UNDERSTANDINGS OF HOW CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE USE OF FISHERIES AND MARINE GENETIC RESOURCES ARE ADDRESSED IN LAW; HOW ACTIVITIES CAUSING POLLUTION AT SEAS, SUCH AS PLASTICS POLLUTION ARE REGULATED; AND HOW HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS CAN BE USED TO ENHANCE OCEANS GOVERNANCE.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION- THIS WORK MAPS AND EVALUATES THE CURRENT PROBLEMS OF CONTAMINATION AND IDENTIFIES EMERGING CONTAMINANTS TO DETERMINE THEIR POTENTIAL RISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO INTERROGATE THE INTERNATIONAL AND NATIONAL LAWS DESIGNED TO LIMIT POLLUTANT FLOWS, IDENTIFYING STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES IN THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.
SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS-SEVERAL PROJECTS INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ORGANISMS AND THEIR BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO MAKE SUCH SYSTEMS MORE RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE.

PORTRAYING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE | LINCOLN CENTRE FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNTHROUGH OUR WORK ON PORTRAYING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE WE INTERROGATE THE REPRESENTATION OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE IN SOCIETY AND ACROSS ALL DISCIPLINES FROM THE ARTS TO THE NATURAL SCIENCES. IN SO DOING, OUR WORK HIGHLIGHTS THE WAY IN WHICH THE REPRESENTATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE IMPACT ON UNDERSTANDINGS OF JUSTICE AND ON ITS DELIVERY. WE SHOW HOW CURRENT REPRESENTATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE MARGINALISE THE INTERESTS OF SOME SECTORS OF SOCIETY AND SPECIES WHILE PRIORITISING OTHERS. WE EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL FOR ALTERNATIVE PORTRAYALS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE, FOR NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND FOR NEW METHODS OF CREATING REPRESENTATIONS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE TO PROVIDE NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE DELIVERY OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE.
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PORTRAYING ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE WE INVESTIGATE TWO MAIN AREAS:
THE MOBILE ARTS FOR PEACE- APROJECT LED BY PROFESSOR ANANDA BREED WHICH, WHILE FOCUSED ON USING THE ARTS TO HELP TRANSITION COUNTRIES TO PEACE, ALSO DRAWS OUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF COMMUNITIES AND THE ECOSYSTEMS OF WHICH THEY ARE PART.
THE INTERACTIVE STORYTELLING FOR ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE - A PROJECT LED BY DR CONOHAR SCOTT EXAMINES HOW PHOTOGRAPHY AND AR CAN BE USED TO BRING ABOUT GREATER AWARENESS OF ECOLOGICAL JUSTICE STRUGGLES IN COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION.
CONSERVATION OF CULTURAL HERITAGE- PREVENTS THE LOSS OF CULTURE, IDENTITY, COMMUNITY, AND SPENSE OF PLACE. THIS WORK INCLUDES VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENTS AND ADAPTATION PLANNING WHICH SPANS INTANGIBLES AS WELL AS OBJECTS AND BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES  THE LOSS OF CULTURE IS A LOSS OF IDENTITY, COMMUNITY, SENSE OF PLACE.

S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAMME UNDER GRANT AGREEMENT NO 727984", 'A PROJECT HOPING TO TACKLE THE HIGH COST OF RETAIL REFRIGERATION HAS BEEN LED BY A CONSORTIUM COMPRISING THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN UK, TESCO STORES LTD, THE GRIMSBY INSTITUTE AND INTELLIGENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS LTD. THE FULL-SCALE PROJECT IS CALLEDTHEDEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC ENERGY CONTROL MECHANISMS FOR FOOD RETAILING REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS.
THE COST OF RETAIL REFRIGERATION TOTALS MORE THAN 14% OF THE UKS ELECTRICITY USAGE AND ALSO REPRESENTS ROUGHLY A THIRD OF A TYPICAL FOOD AND DRINK RETAILERS ENERGY COST. SUPERMARKETS ACROSS THE NATION CURRENTLY UTILISE THOUSANDS OF REFRIGERATION UNITS, NOT ONLY TO KEEP OUR FOOD AND DRINK CHILLED BUT ALSO TO PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE OF PRODUCE AND PREVENT THE GROWTH OF HARMFUL BACTERIA.
THE RESEARCHDEMONSTRATES THE LARGEST DEMAND SIDE RESPONSE (DSR) PROJECT TO FOOD RETAILING NETWORKS USING THE INTERNET OF THINGS (IOT) TECHNOLOGY. IN THE VIDEO BELOW, DIRECTOR OF THELINCOLN INSTITUTE FOR AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY(LIAT), PROFESSOR SIMON PEARSON, DISCUSSES HOW THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER NETWORK (KTN) HELPED IDENTIFY FUNDING THROUGH AN INNOVATE UK COMPETITION.
WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH PARTNERS, THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, UK, DESIGNED AND BUILT THE RESEARCH REFRIGERATION CENTRE (RRC), WHICH IS THE FIRST FACILITY OF ITS KIND IN THE UK AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE CENTRE PRECISELY MODELS THE ESSENTIAL DYNAMICS OF A TYPICAL TESCO EXPRESS CONVENIENCE STORE, PROVIDING SPACE FOR RESEARCHERS TO EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS. THIS ENABLES THE TEAM TO DISCOVER NEW WAYS OF THINKING AND CREATE GREATER OUTCOMES WITH A DIRECT INDUSTRY APPLICATION, FOR EXAMPLE DEFINING AN OPTIMUM NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTROL SYSTEM TO FACILITATE MORE EFFICIENT PACK OPERATION. IN ADDITION, THE RRC IS AVAILABLE AS A DEMONSTRATOR UNIT TO OTHER COMMERCIAL ORGANISATIONS FROM THE UK AND INTERNATIONALLY, MAKING IT A GLOBAL CENTRE FOR RESEARCH INTO REFRIGERATION TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH HAS HELPED THE CONSORTIUM TO DEVELOP NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH WORLD-LEADING ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS WALMART AND SHELL.
THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT, THE RRC HAS ALLOWED THE MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS DEVELOPED BY IMS AND ACADEMICS TO BE PROTOTYPED AND TESTED IN A SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT, MAKING IT A FACILITY THAT CAN TAKE BLUE SKIES THINKING ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO MAINSTREAM INDUSTRY IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME. THE UNIVERSITY USED THE FACILITY TO ESTABLISH A DETAILED UNDERSTANDING OF ENGINEERING RISKS, BY DEVELOPING THE FIRST MATHEMATICAL MODEL (MATLAB) TO ACCURATELY MIRROR THE ESSENTIAL DYNAMICS OF A TESCO EXPRESS CONVENIENCE STORE, AND USING THIS TO MONITOR RESPONSE TO DSR EVENTS. THE TEAM ALSO DEVELOPED A ROBUST SIMULINK MODEL OF A 3-PHASE POWER SYSTEM, WHICH DEMONSTRATED THE CAPACITY OF A MASSIVE REFRIGERATION NETWORK TO HOLD OFF A CONSIDERABLE LOAD IN RESPONSE TO A DSR EVENT (CIRCA 44MW ACROSS 112,000 ASSETS). ALL OF WHICH DEVELOPED INDUSTRY CONFIDENCE IN THE PROPOSED CANDIDACY SOLUTION.
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN HAS ALSO CREATED A NEW CAPABILITY IN THE USE OF DATA AND DATA ANALYTICS TO BUILD HIGHLY COMPLEX ALGORITHMS TO BALANCE THE USE OF SPARE REFRIGERATION CAPACITY TO GENERATE REVENUE POTENTIAL FOR DEMAND RESPONSE WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, ENSURING FOOD QUALITY IS NOT UNDERMINED.
LINCOLNS RESEARCH HAS HELPED TO RAISE THE PROFILE AND REPUTATION OF THE PROJECT WITHIN BOTH THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY, ACHIEVING 4* PUBLICATIONS AND DISSEMINATION AT INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES AND EVENTS. THE PROJECT WAS ALSO SELECTED AS A SUBJECT FOR A PRESTIGIOUS KTN CASE STUDY.

LINCOLN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL WELCOMES APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS WANTING TO PURSUE RESEARCH STUDY AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL, OFFERING A RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO UNDERTAKE BUSINESS-RELATED RESEARCH.
WE WELCOME APPLICATIONS FROM THOSE WISHING TO PURSUE RESEARCH STUDY AT LINCOLN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL. THIS PAGE OFFERS SOME GUIDELINES TO APPLICANTS - PLEASE READ THROUGH THIS INFORMATION IN CONJUNCTION TO THE MPHIL/PHD COURSE INFORMATION. 
BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR APPLICATION WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE RESEARCH GROUPS THAT SIT WITHIN LINCOLN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL, AS ALL RESEARCH SHOULD FIT INTO AT LEAST ONE OF THESE GROUPS.
YOU SHOULD INDICATE IN YOUR APPLICATION HOW YOUR PROPOSED RESEARCH SPECIFICALLY ALIGNS TO THE INTERESTS OF A NAMED RESEARCH GROUP.
GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH DEGREE PROPOSALS
WHEN APPLYING FOR THE MPHIL/PHD PROGRAMME AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, A RESEARCH PROPOSAL WILL BE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF YOUR APPLICATION. IT WILL BE USED TO ASSESS BOTH THE ACADEMIC POTENTIAL OF YOUR PROPOSED RESEARCH AND OUR ABILITY TO SUPERVISE AND SUPPORT YOU TO A SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT IS TO GUIDE YOU IN WRITING A RESEARCH PROPOSAL. WE ARE LOOKING FOR APPROXIMATELY 3,000-5,000 WORD RESEARCH PROPOSAL.
WHAT IS A RESEARCH PROPOSAL
EVALUATE THE CONTEXT OF YOUR IDEAS; READ WIDELY AND RELEVANTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROPOSAL HAS ORIGINALITY, WILL ADD KNOWLEDGE TO THE FIELD AND BUILDS ON EXISTING LITERATURE. THEN STRUCTURE YOUR WRITING AS FOLLOWS:
CONTEXT: SET THE CONTEXT OF YOUR RESEARCH AND EXPLAIN WHAT YOU WILL RESEARCH, WHY THE RESEARCH IS OF VALUE AND HOW YOU PROPOSE TO GO ABOUT IT. YOU ALSO NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOUR PROPOSED RESEARCH HAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO EXISTING BODIES OF LITERATURE. THAT IS, IT SHOULD EXPLAIN CLEARLY HOW YOUR RESEARCH WILL EITHER FILL A GAP, DEVELOP, COMPLETE OR FOLLOW ON FROM PREVIOUS RESEARCH.
AIM(S) AND OBJECTIVES: OUTLINE WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO ACHIEVE. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERTAKING THE RESEARCH, SO BE CLEAR AND CONCISE; YOU CANNOT COVER EVERYTHING ON THE TOPIC WITHIN A PHD PROJECT SO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO EXPLORE. TYPICALLY AN OVERARCHING AIM AND UP TO 5 OBJECTIVES WORKS WELL, AND THEN USE THESE TO JUSTIFY THE MAJOR APPROACHES YOU WILL TAKE.
RESEARCH QUESTIONS: THIS FOLLOWS FROM YOUR AIMS AND OBJECTIVES. EXPLAIN THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT YOUR RESEARCH TO ADDRESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE HYPOTHESES YOU WANT TO TEST.
LITERATURE REVIEW: SUMMARISE CURRENT LITERATURE IN YOUR PROPOSED AREA OF RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THE RELEVANCE AND VALUE OF YOUR RESEARCH. IMPORTANTLY, YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR CONTRIBUTION CLEAR BY DEMONSTRATING YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LITERATURE ON YOUR TOPIC AND HOW YOUR RESEARCH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO IT. IT IS THROUGH THE LITERATURE REVIEW THAT YOU LAY THE FOUNDATIONS FOR YOUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS, BY CRITICALLY EVALUATING WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE, HOW IT COULD BE IMPROVED, WHERE THE GAPS ARE, OR WHAT THE NEW FRONTIERS ARE THAT YOUR RESEARCH WILL ADDRESS.
METHODOLOGY: GIVEN YOUR AIMS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES, CONSIDER YOUR RESEARCH APPROACH (INCLUDING YOUR THEORETICAL/CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK), YOUR MAIN RESEARCH DESIGN (E.G. QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE OR MIXED METHODS) AND THE MOST APPROPRIATE RESEARCH METHODS FOR ACHIEVING THEM. EXPLAIN WHY THE PROPOSED RESEARCH METHOD(S) ARE THE MOST APPROPRIATE METHODOLOGY TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS YOUR RESEARCH QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES. THIS INCLUDES A JUSTIFICATION OF THE METHODOLOGY BY EXPLAINING WHAT ALTERNATIVES HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AND WHY THESE HAVE BEEN DISREGARDED.
PLAN:OUTLINE THE MAIN STAGES OF YOUR RESEARCH AND HOW YOU WOULD ASSESS PROGRESS THROUGHOUT THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT. THIS MAY BE SUPPORTED BY A PROJECT PLAN WITH INDICATIVE MILESTONES PRESENTED IN THE FORM OF A GANTT CHART. IN PROJECT PLANNING, THE SCHEDULING OF INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES IS TYPICALLY WORKED BACKWARDS FROM THE DEADLINE. OF COURSE, SOME TASKS HAVE TO BE CARRIED OUT CONSECUTIVELY BUT OTHER TASKS CAN BE CARRIED OUT CONCURRENTLY.
OUTCOMES:DESCRIBE WHAT YOU HOPE TO DISCOVER AT THE END OF YOUR RESEARCH AND WHAT NEW AREAS IT MIGHT OPEN UP. THIS CAN PROVE DIFFICULT AS YOU CANNOT KNOW THE RESEARCH FINDINGS PRIOR TO COMPLETION, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OR CONTRIBUTION TO KNOWLEDGE.
REFERENCES:INCLUDE A LIST ALL LITERATURE SOURCES CITED IN THE PROPOSAL USING HARVARD STYLE OF REFERENCING.
MAKE THE CONTRIBUTION CLEAR
THIS CANNOT BE STRESSED ENOUGH. YOU NEED TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT LITERATURE ON YOUR TOPIC AND HOW YOUR RESEARCH WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO IT. WHAT WOULD YOUR RESEARCH ADD TO CURRENT LITERATURE AND WHAT WOULD MAKE A UNIQUE CONTRIBUTION TO RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC? TO DO THIS, YOU NEED TO DRAW ON RELEVANT RESEARCH (NOT EVERYTHING EVER WRITTEN ON THE TOPIC BUT KEY ARTICLES/TEXTS) AND DEMONSTRATE CRITICAL REFLECTION ON THIS WORK AND HOW YOUR OWN STUDY WOULD ADD TO IT.
BE SURE TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT KEY WORDS THAT RELATE TO YOUR RESEARCH AND MAKE SURE YOUR TITLE GOES BEYOND JUST DESCRIBING THE TOPIC. IT SHOULD GIVE A CLEAR INDICATION OF YOUR APPROACH AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS.
THIS SHOULD PROVIDE YOU WITH A CLEAR FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERTAKING THE RESEARCH, SO BE CLEAR AND CONCISE. YOU CANNOT COVER EVERYTHING ON THE TOPIC WITHIN A PHD SO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO EXPLORE. TYPICALLY AN OVERARCHING AIM AND 3  5 OBJECTIVES WORKS WELL, AND THEN USE THESE TO JUSTIFY THE MAJOR APPROACHES YOU WILL TAKE, IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS, THEORY, EMPIRICAL APPROACH ETC.
OF COURSE, MPHIL/ PHD STUDY OFTEN EVOLVES AS A RESULT OF DEVELOPING THE LITERATURE REVIEW, BUT HAVING A CLEAR METHOD AT THE START WILL HELP YOU AND POTENTIAL SUPERVISORS DETERMINE THE VIABILITY OF YOUR RESEARCH. SET OUT IN CLEAR TERMS YOUR OVERALL APPROACH (E.G. WILL IT BE MAINLY QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE OR MIXED METHODS RESEARCH, DOES IT INVOLVE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION AND IF SO, WHAT METHODS WILL YOU USE?). JUSTIFY YOUR APPROACH BY ENGAGING IN LITERATURE ON THE PROS AND CONS OF YOUR SPECIFIC METHODOLOGICAL CHOICES SO THAT YOU CAN, FOR EXAMPLE, JUSTIFY WHY SURVEY DATA MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE, OR IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS ARE THE BEST APPROACH, OR INDEED A COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT METHODS. ALSO INCLUDE A CLEAR TIMELINE FOR COMPLETING THESE TASKS ALONG WITH THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF YOUR PHD (LITERATURE REVIEW, ANALYSIS, WRITING UP ETC.). A WELL-DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY SECTION IS CRUCIAL, SO INCLUDE HOW YOU WILL GET THE DATA YOU REQUIRE AND TECHNIQUES REGARDING ANALYSIS AND A RATIONALE FOR THESE CHOICES.
IF YOU ARE APPLYING TO MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND AND TAILOR YOUR PROPOSAL TO THE RELEVANT RESEARCH BEING UNDERTAKEN THERE. RESEARCH THE UNIVERSITY AND DEPARTMENT YOU ARE APPLYING TO, ITS STAFF AND THE RESEARCH THEY ARE UNDERTAKING RELATED TO YOUR TOPIC. READERS CAN EASILY SPOT IF A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN PRODUCED FOR MASS CONSUMPTION.
THIS ONE SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR WORK IS YOUR OWN, WRITTEN IN YOUR OWN WORDS. YOU NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE LITERATURE REVIEW AND THE WAY THE CONTRIBUTION IS DEFINED AND DEVELOPED, AS WELL AS ALL OTHER ELEMENTS, ARE CORRECTLY CITED USING APPROPRIATE REFERENCES AND THAT THEY ARE WRITTEN BY YOU. IF NOT, YOUR APPLICATION WILL NOT SUCCEED.
LET YOUR PASSION FOR THE TOPIC SHINE THROUGH
BY CONSTRUCTING A CLEAR AND WELL WRITTEN PROPOSAL, YOUR INTEREST IN THE TOPIC SHOULD BE CLEAR. DEMONSTRATE YOUR INTEREST IN THE TOPIC AND WHAT THE STUDY AIMS TO ACHIEVE  THIS MAY INCLUDE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THEORY, BUT MIGHT ALSO HAVE PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS SUCH AS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY AND/OR PRACTICE.

ROLE OF CAPTIONS IN SOCIAL MEDIA ENGAGEMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF SUSTAINABILITY ADVERTISING
IN RECENT TIMES, BRANDS REPUTATION AND SALES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY SOCIAL-MEDIA-USERS OPINION. THIS PAPER USED SELF-CONSUMPTION-VISION (SCV), THEORY OF EMOTION, AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE THEORY TO EXPLORES HOW CONSUMERS SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT PURCHASE INTENTIONS AND OTHER SUSTAINABLE-BEHAVIOURAL INTENTIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE SOCIAL-MEDIA-USERS POSITIVE/NEGATIVE CAPTIONS WITH A SUSTAINABILITY-AD. 279 RESPONDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 2 (POSITIVE VS NEGATIVE CAPTION) X 2 (HIGH VS LOW SOURCE EXPERTISE) BETWEEN-SUBJECT EXPERIMENT. THE RESULT SHOWS THAT, CONSUMERS CAN VISUALISE THEMSELVES CONSUMING THE ADVERTISED SUSTAINABLE PRODUCT MORE VIVIDLY FOR POSITIVE CAPTIONS THAN NEGATIVE CAPTIONS. THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF CONSUMPTION VISION PRODUCES HIGHER LEVEL OF EMOTION AND AFFECT SUBSEQUENT SOCIAL-MEDIA-ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SUSTAINABILITY-AD, PURCHASE INTENTIONS AND OTHER SUSTAINABLE-BEHAVIOURAL INTENTIONS. TYPES OF CAPTIONS AND LEVEL OF SOURCE EXPERTISE HAVE SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT ON SOCIAL-MEDIA-ENGAGEMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE USERS WILL ENGAGE MORE FOR POSITIVE CAPTION THAN THE NEGATIVE CAPTION FOR LOW SOURCE EXPERTISE IS LOW, BUT PEOPLE WILL ENGAGE MORE FOR NEGATIVE CAPTION THAN POSITIVE CAPTION, WHEN SOUSE-EXPERTISE IS HIGH. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY OF SUSTAINABILITY-AD DEPENDING ON SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF THE SOCIAL-MEDIA PLATFORMS.
EXPLORING THE UTILISATION OF CHATBOTS IN TOURISM
 EXPECTATIONS FROM THE EMERGING CHATBOTS COMPARATIVE TO THE TRADITIONAL CUSTOMER SUPPORT METHODS SUCH AS EMAIL, PHONE AND MANUAL CHAT SUPPORT. THE RESEARCH WILL ALSO REVIEW THE CHATBOT'S ADOPTION AND ITS BENEFITS AFTER CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES. IN TOURISM 4.0, PRODUCTIVE UTILISATION OF TECHNOLOGY FOR THE GROWTH OF TOURISM IS A PRIMARY FOCUS, AND HENCE, CHATBOTS HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR STRENGTHENING CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES. HOWEVER, UNDERSTANDING CONSUMER INSIGHT ABOUT CHATBOTS CLARIFIES CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS AND ADOPTION CHALLENGES WHICH IS A GUIDELINE IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF HYBRID TOURISM CHATBOTS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING FOR HIGHER CONSUMER ENGAGEMENT, SATISFACTION, AND PERSONALISED COMMUNICATION.", 'ACADEMIA, AMBITION AND ADVENTURE: HOW FOUCAULDIAN DIAGNOSIS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CRITICALITY

"THIS TOUR WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL SURPRISE: SLAVERY HERITAGE TOURISM AND THE EMBODIED ABSENCE OF THE PAST
ASSISTANT PROFESSOR IN CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY AT WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY & RESEARCH, THE NETHERLANDS, A CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF THE INTERNATIONAL PEER-REVIEWED TOURISM PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL PUBLISHED BY ROUTLEDGE (TAYLOR & FRANCIS) AND A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE SCHOOL OF TOURISM AND HOSPITALITY, UNIVERSITY OF JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA.
ACROSS MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES THERE IS AN ONGOING STRUGGLE WITH TELLING THE CONTENTIOUS STORIES OF SLAVERY AND COLONIALISATION. TOURISM PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCES CAN PLAY A TRANSFORMATIVE ROLE IN THIS PROCESS OF TELLING THE STORIES OF HISTORY AND HERITAGE. IN THIS PRESENTATION I EXAMINE A SLAVERY-RELATED HERITAGE TOUR: BLACK HERITAGE AMSTERDAM TOURS (BHAT), USING A FRAMEWORK THAT STRESSES THE NARRATIVE POWER AND TRANSFORMATIVE WORK OF TOURISM IN THE POLITICS OF SLAVERY HERITAGE. BHAT IS A GUIDED WALKING, SIGHTSEEING AND BOAT TOUR THAT EXPLORE AMSTERDAM TO MAKE VISIBLE THE HIDDEN HISTORIES OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA AND COLONIAL HISTORY OF THE NETHERLANDS FROM THE 17TH-CENTURY HISTORY. THE TOUR WEAVES AROUND THE DAM SQUARE THROUGH TO THE HISTORIC DE WALLEN NEIGHBOURHOOD ALONG SOME OF AMSTERDAMS OLDEST STREETS AND BUILDINGS, AND INVOLVES A STOPOVER AT THE RIJKSMUSEUM.
I START BY DEVELOPING THE CONCEPTUAL NOTION OF THE EMBODIED ABSENCE OF THE PAST TO REFER TO THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE BUT NARRATIVE ABSENCE OF THE SHARED HISTORY AND ROLE OF PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT IN EUROPEAN SOCIETIES. I THEN FOCUS ON HOW TOURISM PRACTICES AND PERFORMANCES SUCH AS THE BHAT MAKES VISIBLE AND CHALLENGES THIS EMBODIED ABSENCE OF THE PAST. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO HIGHLIGHT THE TRANSFORMATIVE WORK OF TOURISM BY EXPLORING WHAT VISITORS TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR TOUR OF SLAVERY AND COLONIAL HERITAGE IN AMSTERDAM. SPECIFICALLY, IT EXAMINES VISITORS THOUGHTS ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF DUTCH SLAVERY AND COLONIAL HERITAGE DURING THE TOUR AND THEIR VIEWS ON THE PHYSICAL REMNANTS OF SUCH HERITAGE IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. DATA FOR THIS STUDY COMES FROM 147 VISITOR REVIEW COMMENTS POSTED ON THE TRAVEL WEBSITE TRIPADVISOR UNDER THE BHAT PAGE BETWEEN APRIL 2013  AUGUST, 2020. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH IS UTILISED IN GAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT VISITORS LEARN ABOUT DUTCH SLAVERY AND COLONIAL HISTORY DURING THE TOUR. THIS STUDY SHOWS HOW THE CULTURAL IMAGINATION OF SLAVERY IS NEGOTIATED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE SLAVERY HERITAGE TOURISM PRACTICES SEEN AS LEISURELY PURSUIT AS WELL AS SEEN AS TRANSFORMATIVE MEMORIAL OF THE PAST.
INNOVATION IN AGRICULTURAL AND COUNTY SHOWS: CONCEPTUALISING THE E-EVENTSCAPE.
IN RESPONSE TO THE CANCELLATION OF A HOST OF EVENTS DURING THE SUMMER OF 2020, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE RAPID INNOVATION THAT CREATED AN ONLINE COUNTY SHOW. COUNTY SHOWS ARE TRADITIONALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AGRICULTURE AND THE WIDER RURAL ECONOMY OF A REGION AND PROVIDE A RANGE OF VISITOR EXPERIENCES ALONGSIDE BUSINESS NETWORKING AND TRADING OPPORTUNITIES. THE CASE OF THE ONLINE LINCOLNSHIRE SHOW SOUGHT TO REPLICATE MANY ASPECTS OF A PHYSICAL SHOW, AND THIS PAPER EVALUATES ITS EFFECTIVENESS BY APPLYING A NEWLY DEVELOPED E-EVENTSCAPE MODEL. A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH GENERATED DATA FROM BUSINESSES, VISITORS AND THE SHOW ORGANISER. SURVEYS AND SOCIAL MEDIA FEEDBACK FROM ATTENDEES CAPTURED OVERALL SATISFACTION LEVELS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS. PARTICIPATION IN THE ONLINE BUSINESS BREAKFAST EVENT ALONG WITH AN INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO) OF THE SHOW PROVIDED DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INNOVATION OCCURRING. THE NATURE OF INNOVATION WAS STRONGLY ROOTED IN PLACE, DESPITE CREATING A VIRTUAL PRODUCT. LOCAL NETWORKS AND SUPPORTERS WERE CRITICAL TO STAGING THE ONLINE SHOW. THE PROPOSED E-EVENTSCAPE MODEL ALLOWED AN EFFECTIVE APPRAISAL OF THE ONLINE SHOW, IDENTIFYING MANY STRENGTHS IN TERMS OF THE USER INTERFACE AND AESTHETICS AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT, ESPECIALLY LINKED TO GREATER INTERACTIVE ENGAGEMENT. THE IMPACTS OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) HAVE ACCELERATED DIGITAL INNOVATION IN A RANGE OF EVENTS AND FESTIVALS. THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE THE EVOLVING ROLE OF SHOWS IN THE RURAL ECONOMY AND THE INNOVATION PROCESSES THAT HAVE EMERGED. AS WELL AS PRESENTING ORIGINAL INSIGHTS INTO RURAL INNOVATION, THE PAPER DEVELOPS AND TESTS A NEW E-EVENTSCAPE MODEL APPLICABLE TO THE GROWING FIELD OF ONLINE EVENTS AND FESTIVALS. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SCOPE FOR ORGANISERS TO EMBED ONLINE CONTENT INTO THE FUTURE OF MANY LIVE SHOWS AND FESTIVALS, FAR BEYOND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
THE EN-ROUTE CONSUMER-PRACTICES HAVE LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED IN CONSUMER RESEARCH, EVEN THOUGH LIFESTYLES, TASTES AND CONSUMPTION PRACTICES ARE OMNIPRESENT ON THE STREET, ON ROUTE TO HOME AND TO PLACES OF WORK. APPLIED TO A STUDY OF IMPRESSION MANAGEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY, THE RATHER NEW WALKING-WITH METHOD SEEKS OUT INQUISITIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WHILE ACCOMPANYING THEM TO AND FROM WORK. CAPITALIZING ON THE SENSE-STIMULATION EFFECT AND RESONANT VALIDITY GENERATED FROM THE PHYSICAL SURROUNDINGS AND BODILY MOVEMENT, THE NEW APPROACH IS FOUND TO BE A DESIRABLE ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENT TO THE TRADITIONAL SIT-DOWN NARRATIVE INTERVIEWS AND OTHER RESEARCH METHODS.
EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TOURISM AND POVERTY USING THE CAPABILITY APPROACH
TOURISM HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A TOOL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION OVER MANY DECADES. YET TOURISM RESEARCH ON POVERTY TO DATE LARGELY FOCUSES ON THE INCOME-BASED POVERTY ANALYSIS AND DOES NOT FULLY CONSIDER THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF POVERTY OR THE VIEWS OF POOR PEOPLE. APPLYING THE CAPABILITY APPROACH, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE OPPORTUNITIES PROVIDED BY TOURISM DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO ACHIEVING WELL-BEING FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY. THE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN IN A SMALL COASTAL TOURIST DESTINATION IN THE NORTHEAST OF BRAZIL USING A MIXED- METHODS APPROACH THAT COMBINED QUANTITATIVE VALUE CHAIN ANALYSIS AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH PHOTO-ELICITATION. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT PARTICIPANTS VALUE OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH MONETARY AND NON-MONETARY TOURISM RESOURCES AND THESE OPPORTUNITIES HELP THEM ACHIEVE DIVERSE ASPECTS OF WELL-BEING. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES HOW THE CAPABILITY APPROACH CAN HELP INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF TOURISM DEVELOPMENT ON POVERTY REDUCTION AND WELL-BEING OF POOR PEOPLE IN A MORE HOLISTIC AND NUANCED WAY BY CONSIDERING THE PLURAL AND RELATIVE NATURE OF POVERTY AND WELL-BEING.
PUBS. SELLING THIRD PLACES BY THE POUND: LANDLORDS, LOYALTY AND A LABOUR OF LOVE
OLDENBURG (1989) PROCLAIMS THE GREAT BRITISH PUB IS A THIRD PLACE WHICH IS DESCRIBED AS A HOME AWAY FROM HOME SET IN A COMMERCIAL OUTLET WHERE CUSTOMERS CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF BELONGING, RESTORATION AND REJUVENATION. HOWEVER, THE LANDLORD ASSUMES A ROLE THAT IS ONE OF PARTICIPATION AND INTEGRATION WHERE THEY TAKE ON A SOCIAL SUPPORTIVE AND COMMUNITY ROLE IN ADDITION TO THAT OF A COMMERCIAL MANAGER. WHILE OLDENBURG (1989) RENDERS THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT INVISIBLE, THE LANDLORD IS CONSIDERED SOCIALLY SIGNIFICANT. THIS COMPLETE MEMBERSHIP ETHNOGRAPHY POSITIONED THE RESEARCHER BACKSTAGE FOR 16 MONTHS TO EXPLORE THE ROLE OF THE LANDLORD THROUGH THE LENS OF MANAGEMENT TO UNPACK THE COMPLEXITIES AND DIFFICULTIES OF MANAGING A PUB AS A THIRD PLACE. THE RESEARCH INTRODUCES THE THIRD PLACE DEPENDENCY MODEL WHICH CONCEPTUALISES THIRD PLACES AS EMERGING FROM SOCIAL STABILITY WHICH ACTS AS A FACILITATOR OF BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY. IT RE-CONCEPTUALISES THE THIRD PLACE AS A FRAGILE SOCIO-SPATIAL MANIFESTATION OF A FEELING OR A SENTIMENT WITHIN A GIVEN PLACE AND TIME WHERE THE LANDLORDS ROLE AT ITS MOST BASIC, IS TO INTRODUCE AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL STABILITY. THE DIFFICULTY EMERGES WHEN SOCIAL STABILITY IS THREATENED BY DEVIANT CUSTOMER BEHAVIOUR FURTHER COMPLICATED BY AN EMBEDDED SOCIAL SERVICESCAPE. IT INTRODUCES CUSTOMER EQUILIBRIUM MANAGEMENT (CEM) AS A FRAMEWORK PROMOTING ONGOING POSITIVE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES IN A SERVICE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL STABILITY.
IMPACT IS MORE THAN A REF EXERCISE. INCREASINGLY, FUNDING BODIES REQUIRE EVIDENCE THAT IMPACT PLANNING HAS BEEN EMBEDDED IN FUNDING APPLICATIONS. THIS SESSION WILL LOOK BRIEFLY AT THE VISITOR ECONOMY CASE STUDY FOR THE CURRENT REF BUT WILL ALSO INVESTIGATE WHAT IMPACT MEANS IN A BROADER RESEARCH CONTEXT, HOW TO PLAN FOR IT AND HOW TO MAKE THE MOST OF IMPACT THAT MAY HAPPEN BY CHANCE.
BRAND EXTENSION (BE) STRATEGY INVOLVES THE USE OF AN ESTABLISHED BRAND TO INTRODUCE SIMILAR (HIGH FIT) OR DISSIMILAR (LOW FIT) NEW PRODUCTS IN RELATION TO THE PARENT BRANDS ORIGINAL OFFERINGS, SUCH AS PRODUCT CATEGORY OR CLASS. FOR EXAMPLE, COLGATES ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH AND COLGATES READY MEAL REPRESENT HIGH AND LOW PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT BES, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE THIS STRATEGY CAN CAPITALISE ON THE PARENT BRANDS EQUITY TO GROW MARKET SHARE, IT DOES NOT ALWAYS SUCCEED. THIS RESEARCH PROPOSES THAT CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO BES CAN HINDER ADOPTION. A GROWING NUMBER OF MARKETING STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES CAN ELICIT CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES, WHICH INFLUENCE THEIR ATTITUDINAL AND BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES TOWARDS THE PRODUCT. WHILE PREVIOUS BE RESEARCH HAS INVESTIGATED HOW AFFECTIVE DIMENSIONS INFLUENCE CONSUMERS EVALUATION OF BES, NO RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE EFFECTS OF CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TOWARDS BES. THIS RESEARCH DEPLOYS THE COGNITIVE APPRAISAL THEORY TO UNDERSTAND HOW: (1) INDIVIDUALS INTERPRETATION OF A BE SITUATION (APPRAISAL DIMENSIONS) PRECEDES THEIR EMOTIONAL RESPONSE, AND (2) CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES AFFECT BEHAVIOURS. HENCE, THE CURRENT RESEARCH PROPOSES THAT THE BES PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT IS THE BE APPRAISAL SITUATION, WHICH INFLUENCES THE CONSUMERS COGNITIVE APPRAISAL PROCESS. THEN, THE RESEARCH DRAWS ON THE CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL BRAND ATTACHMENT AS A PERSONAL FACTOR AND BRAND NAME STRUCTURE AS A BRANDING FACTOR IN THE BE APPRAISAL SITUATION. THESE FACTORS INTERACT WITH PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT AND INFLUENCE CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES TO BES. TO ADDRESS THESE HYPOTHESES, THIS RESEARCH DEVELOPED A SCALE FOR MEASURING EMOTIONS IN THE BE CONTEXT (N = 1617). THIS SCALE IS USED IN SUBSEQUENT STUDIES. STUDY 1 (N = 353) CONFIRMS THAT APPRAISAL DIMENSIONS CAN PREDICT CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES IN BE CONSUMPTION SITUATIONS. STUDY 2 (N = 393) DEMONSTRATES THAT PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT CAN AFFECT CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL RESPONSES THROUGH THE COGNITIVE APPRAISAL PROCESS, AND CONSUMERS EMOTIONAL BRAND ATTACHMENT POSITIVELY MODERATES THEIR EMOTIONAL RESPONSES THROUGH APPRAISAL DIMENSIONS. IN STUDY 3 (N = 370), IT IS FOUND THAT A SUB-BRANDING STRATEGY CAN WEAKEN THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT ON CONSUMERS NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL RESPONSES. STUDY 4 (N = 353) REPLICATES ALL RESULTS FROM THE PREVIOUS STUDIES. EACH OF THESE STUDIES CONFIRMS THAT EMOTIONAL RESPONSES CAN INFLUENCE CONSUMERS ATTITUDINAL AND BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES TO BES. THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED
GENDER, DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE UK EVENTS INDUSTRY
THE EVENTS INDUSTRY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY HALF A MILLION FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT JOBS IN THE UK ACROSS A RANGE OF SECTORS FROM MICE, TO SPORTS EVENTS, TO ARTS AND CULTURAL EVENTS. DESPITE BEING FEMALE DOMINATED IN NUMERICAL TERMS, THERE IS A CLEAR GLASS CEILING IN THE INDUSTRY, WITH WOMEN AND MINORITY GROUPS UNDER-REPRESENTED AT SENIOR LEVELS. THIS PRESENTATION REPORTS ON SURVEY RESEARCH CONDUCTED JUST BEFORE THE PANDEMIC PLUNGED THE EVENTS INDUSTRY INTO UNCERTAINTY AND TURMOIL, AND INTERVIEWS FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE LOCKDOWN. RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN THE EVENTS WORKFORCE, AND SHOW CLEAR GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CAREER SUCCESS (BASED ON PAY, PROMOTIONS, LEVEL OF SENIORITY) AND CAREER SATISFACTION. FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 CRISIS THAT RISKS PUSHING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION OFF THE AGENDA AND ENTRENCHING INEQUALITY IN THE UK EVENTS WORKFORCE.
"NINE ICONIC ADDRESSES, NINE EXTRAORDINARY HOTELS, ONE UNIQUE COLLECTION  STYLISTIC ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE OF LUXURY IN THE MARKETING MATERIALS OF THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION
THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION (DC) IS A GROUP OF 9 LUXURY HOTELS LOCATED ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE HOTELS, THE LOCATIONS, AND THE PARTICULAR BUILDINGS ARE CHOSEN METICULOUSLY TO CREATE THIS UNIQUE COLLECTION. THE WORD COLLECTION, AN OBVIOUS BORROWING FROM THE LANGUAGE OF FASHION AND DESIGN, HAS BEEN CHOSEN ON PURPOSE  TO INVOKE CAREFULLY CURATED ART RATHER THAN BRING TO MIND A RUN-OF-THE-MILL HOTEL CHAIN. THE COLLECTION IS CONSISTENT IN HOW IT PRESENTS ITSELF, IN GENERAL MARKETING MATERIALS, IN THE PROMOTION OF PARTICULAR HOTELS, AND IN HOW ITS REPRESENTATIVES SPEAK ABOUT IT. AS A LINGUIST WITH INTEREST IN BRANDING AND ADVERTISING, IN THIS TALK I WILL EXPLORE HOW THIS SELF-PROCLAIMED LANGUAGE OF LUXURY IS EMPLOYED TO CREATE A CERTAIN BRAND IMAGE FOR THE DORCHESTER COLLECTION. MY DATA WILL BE THE DC BOOKLET BRIEFLY PRESENTING EACH OF THE HOTELS, THE HISTORY OF THE SPECIFIC HOTELS AVAILABLE ON THEIR WEBSITES (SO-CALLED MEDIA KITS), AS WELL AS THE WEBSITES THEMSELVES. I WILL APPLY STYLISTIC ANALYSIS TO THESE TEXTS, WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE VOCABULARY AND GRAMMAR CHOICES. MY AIM IS TO FIND WHAT EXACTLY THE LANGUAGE OF LUXURY IS  IS IT QUANTIFIABLE AT ALL? THIS AREA HAS BEEN UNDER-RESEARCHED SO FAR, BUT I WILL DRAW ON THE BRAND LINGUISTICS FRAMEWORK, THE EXISTING WORK ON TOURISM DISCOURSE, AND THE EXAMINATION OF SIMILAR LUXURY HOTELS.
CONTESTED HERITAGE, COLLIDING NARRATIVES: THE VISITOR ECONOMY OF NE ITALY
LOCATED AT THE INTERSECTION OF LATIN, GERMANIC AND SLAVIC CULTURES, THIS REGION HAS BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED BY WAR, SHIFTING BORDERS, TOTALITARIAN REGIMES AND CONFLICTING TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. THESE EVENTS HAVE SHAPED MEMORIES, NARRATIVES AND AN ARRAY OF CONTROVERSIAL MEMORIALS ABOUT DRAMATIC EVENTS IN THE PAST. THE PRESENTATION WILL EXPLORE THIS LANDSCAPE AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LOCAL VISITOR ECONOMY
LEVERAGING CROSS-GENDER BRAND EXTENSIONS (NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS UNDER THE SAME BRAND NAME TO CUSTOMERS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX) BY GENDERED BRANDS CAN PRESENT A WAY TO MEET THE NEED FOR BRAND GROWTH. HOWEVER, HOW TO IMPLEMENT SUCH STRATEGIES REMAINS A CHALLENGE. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH IS TO LAUNCH A BRAND EXTENSION IN THE SAME OR SIMILAR PRODUCT CATEGORY (HIGH PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT). HOWEVER, IN THE CONTEXT OF CROSS-GENDER BRAND EXTENSION, THE ISSUE CAN BE MORE COMPLICATED. INSTEAD, USING LOW PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT STRATEGY CAN HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES DUE TO ITS ABILITY TO DISTANCE THE EXTENSION FROM THE PARENT BRAND. TWO EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES CONFIRM THAT INTRODUCING LOW (VERSUS HIGH) PRODUCT CATEGORY FIT CROSS-GENDER BRAND EXTENSIONS MITIGATE THE PARENT BRANDS BRAND PERSONALITY DILUTION (I.E., MASCULINITY OR FEMININITY), BRINGING MORE POSITIVE EVALUATIONS TO THE PARENT BRAND AMONGST EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND HIGHER PURCHASE INTENTION AMONGST NEW TARGET CUSTOMERS ON THE CROSS-GENDER BRAND EXTENSION.

EACH OF OUR WORK BASED DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMMES IS DIVIDED INTO FIVE OR SIX MODULES, WHICH ARE ACCESSED VIA OUR ONLINE VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, BLACKBOARD. YOU WILL WORK THROUGH EACH MODULE IN TURN, AT A PACE THAT YOU SET, UNTIL YOU COMPLETE YOUR DEGREE PROGRAMME. YOUR FINAL GRADE WILL REFLECT YOUR PERFORMANCE ON EACH MODULE, INCLUDING A DISSERTATION ON A SUBJECT OF YOUR CHOOSING.
MODULE ASSIGNMENTS TAKE THE FORM OF ESSAYS, PORTFOLIOS, REFLECTIVE LOGS AND REPORTS, WITH EACH BEING ASSESSED BY YOUR MODULE TUTOR AGAINST THE LEARNING OUTCOMES OF THE MODULE YOU ARE UNDERTAKING.
THERE IS A BLACKBOARD SITE SPECIFIC TO EACH MODULE THAT INCLUDES YOUR STUDY GUIDE, A MODULE GUIDE AND THE HARVARD REFERENCING GUIDE AS WELL AS OTHER RESOURCES. COURSE READING MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMATS COMPATIBLE WITH MOST DEVICES FROM OUR VAST DIGITAL LIBRARY COLLECTION.

AS A DISTANCE LEARNING STUDENT UNDERTAKING INDIVIDUAL STUDY, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE COURSE REQUIREMENTS ARE AND WHEN YOUR ASSIGNMENTS ARE DUE.
WE SUGGEST UPDATING YOUR TUTOR ON YOUR PROGRESS ONCE A FORTNIGHT, BEING SURE TO FLAG ANY ISSUES AT AN EARLY STAGE. SHOULD YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE FOR ANY REASON, OR IF YOU BEGIN TO FEEL OVERWHELMED, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR TUTOR. YOUR TUTOR IS THERE TO HELP YOU.
REMEMBER THAT YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED AND SUCCESSFULLY MANAGED CHALLENGING SITUATIONS OVER THE COURSE OF YOUR CAREER. YOUR MAIN CHALLENGES WILL BE BALANCING STUDY, WORK AND LIFE COMMITMENTS, AND RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH ACADEMIA.
BEFORE YOU COMMENCE YOUR DEGREE, YOUR PROGRAMME LEADER WILL SEND YOU A WELCOME EMAIL WITH SOME INFORMATION TO GET YOU STARTED. THIS IS THE EMAIL ADDRESS YOU WILL USE TO CONTACT THEM ONCE YOUR PROGRAMME IS UNDERWAY.
YOU WILL FIND YOUR MODULE TUTORS EMAIL ADDRESSES ON THE RELEVANT MODULE SITES ON BLACKBOARD.

OUR RESEARCH IS BASED ON MICROECONOMIC MODELS ENCOMPASSING HETEROGENEOUS INDIVIDUAL AND FIRM BEHAVIOURS AND EXTENDS TO THE FUNCTIONING OF PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE MACROECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE THAT BRINGS IN THE PICTURE THE INTERPLAY OF INSTITUTIONS, MARKETS, AND POLICIES IN THE DIVERSE CONTEXTS OF DEVELOPING, EMERGING, AND DEVELOPED ECONOMIES.
A WELL-FUNCTIONING MARKETS AND A VIGOROUS ENTERPRISES ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION. FINANCE IS CENTRAL TO ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT AND VICE VERSA, AND LARGE PARTS OF BOTH AREAS OF INQUIRY REVOLVE AROUND THE BEHAVIOUR AND PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS. UNDERSTANDING THESE BEHAVIOURS AND OUTCOMES IS IMPORTANT FROM THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVES. EVEN IF THE MARKETS ARE EFFICIENT AND INDIVIDUALS RATIONAL MOST OF THE TIME, WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE TIMES WHEN THEY ARE NOT.
ON THE BACKDROP OF THE 2007 FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE ECONOMISTS HAVE BEEN BLAMED FOR THEIR FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF FINANCE AND FINANCIERS FOR PUTTING TOO MUCH FAITH IN THE MODELS PRODUCED BY ECONOMISTS. WE RECOGNISE THAT INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS CANNOT BE THE RATIONAL ACTORS WHO FIT NEATLY INTO ACADEMIC MODELS AND THAT THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT IS GOOD ONLY UP TO A POINT, AFTER WHICH IT MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT ECONOMIC GROWTH. THEREFORE IN OUR RESEARCH WE ASPIRE TO DEAL WITH THE WORLD AS IT IS, NOT THE WORLD THAT IS EASILY MODELLED.

STUDENTS ARE INTRODUCED TO CORE SKILLS OF LITERATURE REVIEW: CRITICAL THINKING, ORGANISATION, REFLECTION AND EVALUATION. LITERATURE REVIEWS SERVE A VARIETY OF PURPOSES BUT ARE OFTEN THE STARTING POINT IN THE ARGUMENTS OF DISCOVERY AND ADVOCACY ASSOCIATED WITH ENQUIRY AND INVESTIGATION. THE RAE (2008) DEFINITION OF RESEARCH CAN BE USED AS A STARTING POINT : RESEARCH IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD AS ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION UNDERTAKEN IN ORDER TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING. THE STUDENT AS PRODUCER DEFINITION (USER GUIDE, 2010-2011, 6) DIRECTS THAT PROGRESSIVELY WHAT MATTERS IS THAT IN CERTAIN RESEARCH-ENGAGED TEACHING AND LEARNING SITUATIONS IS LESS THE ORIGINALITY OF THE RESEARCH OUTCOME THAN THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS ACQUIRED.IN THE CONTEXT OF WBDL IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNISE THE VALUE OF MULTI-MODAL TEXTS AND SETTINGS, BOTH AS INTEGRAL TO THE RESEARCH ENVIRONMENT AND SOURCES OF VALID INFORMATION. MOREOVER, STUDENTS WILL BUILD A CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT RESEARCH DESIGNS IN ORDER TO EVALUATE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS INFORM THEIR OWN INVESTIGATIONS.ENQUIRY IS PRESENTED AS A MESSY RATHER THAN PRESCRIPTIVE PROCESS INVOLVING A SERIES OF CHOICES AND DILEMMAS, INCLUDING THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH ETHICS AND RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT. WHILST STUDENTS ARE INTRODUCED TO THE RANGE OF RESEARCH DESIGNS, THE MODULE PLACES PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THOSE RELEVANT TO WORK BASED RESEARCH ENQUIRY: CASE STUDY, MIXED METHOD, ACTION RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PROGRESSIVELY, IN LINE WITH STUDENT AS PRODUCER PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF DISCOVERY, EVALUATION AND UNCERTAINTY, THE NEW STUDENT WILL GAIN A LEGITIMATE CONTRIBUTION TO THE RESEARCH PROCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION, AND AN AUTHENTIC EXPERIENCE.
THE ASSESSMENT COMPRISES A PORTFOLIO OF WORK WHICH MAY INCLUDE: A SHORT WRITTEN EVALUATION OF RELEVANT PUBLISHED ACADEMIC RESEARCH; ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHIC WORK; PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION TASKS AND OUTLINE RESEARCH DESIGNS; RESOLUTION OF ETHICAL DILEMMAS.THE PORTFOLIO WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF 3000 WORDS (+/- 10%)
THIS MODULE IS DESIGNED TO DEVELOP AND ASSESS THE STUDENTS ABILITY TO REFLECT CRITICALLY ON LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCES. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT ACADEMIC THEORY AND LITERATURE WILL BE CRITICALLY REVIEWED AND APPLIED TO THE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AND ORGANISATIONAL CONTEXT TO ALLOW FOR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING.REFLECTION AS A TECHNIQUE FOR AIDING AND REINFORCING LEARNING IS A POWERFUL TOOL IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND A WIDE RANGE OF OTHER LEARNING SITUATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTS. REFLECTIVE PRACTICE IS ESSENTIALLY ABOUT LEARNING AND DEVELOPING THROUGH EXAMINING OWN PERCEPTIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED AND CONSIDERING HOW THE EVENT MAY BE PERCEIVED BY OTHERS. AT AN ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL, CRITICAL REFLECTION IS THE BASIS FOR MAINTAINING THE APPROPRIATE ALIGNMENT OF AN ORGANISATION WITH ITS ENVIRONMENT AND AS SUCH, FORMS THE BASIS FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE. IT CAN, IF USED CORRECTLY, ACT AS A CATALYST FOR CONTINUAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE ESSENTIAL MANAGEMENT DISCIPLINES OF: PEOPLE, RESOURCE, PERFORMANCE, CONFLICT, AND CHANGE, IN A RAPIDLY CHANGING LEADERSHIP AND MANAGERIAL ENVIRONMENT.THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO REFLECTION. THIS MODULE WILL UTILISE THE FORMAT OF A STRUCTURED REFLECTIVE LEARNING LOG AS A USEFUL TOOL FOR REFLECTIVE PRACTICE. A REFLECTIVE LEARNING LOG IS MORE THAN A SIMPLE DIARY OF EVENTS: IT IS INTENDED TO CHART PROGRESS, THINKING AND DEVELOPMENT, AND KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION. THE THOUGHT AND DISCIPLINE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITING AND PRODUCTION OF THE REFLECTIVE LEARNING LOG, SUPPORTS THE OVERALL AIM OF LEARNING THROUGH REFLECTION

LINCOLN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SCHOOL IS A MEMBER OF AACSB, A GLOBAL NONPROFIT ASSOCIATION, CONNECTING EDUCATORS, STUDENTS, AND BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL: TO CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF GREAT LEADERS.
AFTER HAVING SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (SMDP) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF STELLENBOSCH BUSINESS SCHOOL IN SOUTH AFRICA, I OBTAINED CREDITS TOWARDS ENROLLING FOR A BA HONOURS DEGREE IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. MY SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE SMDP PROGRAMME ALLOWED ME TO BE RECOGNISED FOR 240 CREDITS TOWARDS MY BA HONOURS DEGREE IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT AND I THEREFORE DECIDED TO REGISTER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN FOR THE OUTSTANDING 120 CREDITS.
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO STUDY WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN? ARE YOU PLEASED YOU MADE THAT DECISION?
I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE AN EFFECTIVE INDEPENDENT LEARNER THAT IS SELF-MOTIVATED, ABLE TO MANAGE MY TIME AND PERSONAL LEARNING PROCESS EFFECTIVELY ACCORDING TO MY PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THE WORK BASED DISTANCE LEARNING APPROACH (WBDL) USED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN PERFECTLY SUPPORTS MY PART-TIME LEARNING STYLE APPROACH. TOGETHER WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND ONLINE / VIRTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE (BLACKBOARD) THAT THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES FOR COMMUNICATING, THE WBDL APPROACH TOWARDS LEARNING MAKES FOR A PERFECT RECIPE FOR A FULL-TIME EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL LIKE ME TO DEVELOP MYSELF FURTHER AND STILL BE ABLE TO PERFORM MY DAILY FUNCTIONS AS A FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE. WHEN THINGS BECOME PRESSURISED AT WORK I AM ABLE TO TAKE A STUDY BREAK / HOLIDAY WHEN IT SUITS MY CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY ALONE IS WORTH ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD.
WHAT ARE YOU ENJOYING/DID YOU ENJOY MOST ABOUT YOUR CHOSEN COURSE?
I ENJOYED THE FACT THAT ALL THE UNITS IN THE WBDL PROGRAMME MADE PROVISION FOR REAL TIME APPLICATION OF THEORY IN MY WORK ENVIRONMENT. AS I WAS PROGRESSING THROUGH EACH UNIT, IMMEDIATE DIRECT BENEFITS WERE DERIVED FOR ME AND MY ORGANIZATION. I CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO START DESCRIBING HOW MUCH SATISFACTION SUCH AN EXPERIENCE PROVIDES. THIS APPROACH IS TREMENDOUSLY STIMULATING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOLVING REAL-TIME ISSUES IN THE WORKPLACE.
WHAT ARE/WERE THE POSITIVE ASPECTS OF YOUR COURSE ON YOU AND YOUR CAREER?
THE MOST POSITIVE ASPECTS RELATE TO THE DIRECT AND IMMEDIATE APPLICATION OF LESSONS LEARNED IN MY PLACE OF WORK FROM THE VARIOUS MODULES THAT MADE UP THE COURSE. AS A RESULT OF THIS COURSE I AM NOW MUCH BETTER EMPOWERED AND POSITIONED TO BE ABLE TO ASSIST MY ORGANISATION TO MANAGE OUR EVER CHANGING ENVIRONMENT MORE EFFECTIVELY.
HAVE ANY OF THE MODULES YOU HAVE UNDERTAKEN HAD PARTICULAR IMPACT ON YOUR ROLE OR YOUR EMPLOYER? IF SO, HOW?
ALL THE MODULES IMPACTED ME AND MY EMPLOYER POSITIVELY. THE ONE ASPECT THAT REQUIRES HIGHLIGHTING IS MY LEARNING REGARDING THE STUDY OF REFLECTION. BEFORE MY STUDY OF REFLECTION, I WAS USING THE TERM RELATIVELY LOOSE TO DESCRIBE HOW I PERCEIVE/EXPERIENCE A SITUATION. AFTER MY LEARNING OF WHAT REFLECTION REALLY IS, I WAS ABLE TO ENGAGE MY ENVIRONMENT IN A MUCH MORE STRUCTURED MANNER WITH THE HELP OF REFLECTION LOGS AND BE ABLE TO REFLECT AND LEARN FROM ANY SITUATION NO MATTER HOW INTENSE. THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT MODULE IMPACTED MY EMPLOYER POSITIVELY. I WAS ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PARTNER IN HR TOWARDS DEVELOPING A CHANGE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK WHICH MY EMPLOYER USED TO MANAGE THE CHANGE EFFECTIVELY IN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST EVER IT PROJECTS, CALLED TITAN.
WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO SOMEONE ELSE LOOKING AT THIS COURSE?
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE HIGH QUALITY STRUCTURED MODULAR CONTENT, I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE, ESPECIALLY FULL- TIME WORKING INDIVIDUALS, TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER INCLUDING A COURSE LIKE THIS IN THEIR PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN. THERE ARE SIMILAR COURSES AVAILABLE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY, INTEGRITY AND INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION, IT IS EXTREMELY CHALLENGING TO FIND A BETTER MATCH. POTENTIAL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS CAN NOW OBTAIN A CREDIBLE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED BUSINESS DEGREE QUALIFICATION THAT WONT COST THEM AN ARM AND A LEG. NOW THAT IS TRULY EXCITING!
DO YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ABOUT THE COURSE OR THE UNIVERSITY?

ANDREW BREMNER IS THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER AT B-LOGIC, AN IT MANAGEMENT SERVICE PROVIDER THAT FOCUSES ON PROVIDING ENTERPRISE-CLASS IT OUTSOURCE SERVICES TO THE MID-CORPORATE MARKET. B-LOGIC OPERATES FROM CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA AND DELIVERS SERVICES TO LOCAL, NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS. HE COMPLETED THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (SMDP) AT USB-ED AND THE BA (HONS) IN BUSINESS MANAGEMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IN THE UK.
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO ENROL FOR THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME (SMDP)?
I CHOSE TO ENROL IN THE SMDP AT A TIME WHEN I WAS LOOKING TO BROADEN MY BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND TO ESTABLISH A STRONG MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP FOUNDATION. THE SMDP ENTICED ME, AS THE COURSE PROGRAMME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHLY REPUTABLE ORGANISATION WITH HIGH STANDARDS AND EXCELLENT TUTORS. I NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT BY DOING THIS COURSE, I WAS NOT WASTING TIME AND THAT I WOULD GROW IN MY THINKING AS A RESULT.
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THE LINCOLN QUALIFICATION? (WERE YOU AWARE OF THIS OPTION AND HAD A LONG TERM STRATEGY?)
I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE LINCOLN QUALIFICATION WHEN CHOOSING THE SMDP. HAD I KNOWN PRIOR, IT WOULD ONLY HAVE CEMENTED MY DECISION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SMDP AND THEN JUMP INTO THE LINCOLN DEGREE AFTER. THE OFFER WAS TOO GOOD TO REFUSE, AND IN HINDSIGHT HAS CERTAINLY PAID FOR ITSELF. THE LINCOLN QUALIFICATION WAS A WAY OF FAST TRACKING MY DEGREE, WHILST ALSO ASSOCIATING MYSELF WITH ANOTHER REPUTABLE LEARNING INSTITUTION. THE ONLINE LEARNING PROCESS WAS FLEXIBLE AND EASY TO USE. THE STUDY MATERIAL WAS ALSO VERY ACCESSIBLE, COMPREHENSIVE. THE MOST ATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF THE COURSE WAS THE WORK-BASED LEARNING APPROACH, USING MY OWN ORGANISATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES TO APPLY THEORY TO PRACTICAL SITUATIONS. NOT ONLY DID I BENEFIT FROM THIS APPLIED LEARNING, BUT ALSO MY ORGANISATION AS I APPLIED THE THEORY TO MY OWN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE WORKPLACE.
WHAT WERE YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF THE SMDP AND THE ONLINE QUALIFICATION ONCE YOU COMPLETED OUR SMDP?
ALTHOUGH YOU COULD SAY MY PERSONAL "BRAND" BENEFITTED FROM THE CERTIFICATIONS, IT WAS ALWAYS MY INTENTION TO BUILD A STRONG THEORETICAL BASE UPON WHICH TO GROW MY OWN MANAGERIAL STYLE AND EQUIP MYSELF WITH AN ARSENAL OF MANAGERIAL TOOLS AND MODELS. I NEEDED THE THEORY TO UNDERPIN MY DECISION-MAKING, AND THEREFORE TO ALLOW ME TO MANAGE WITH CONFIDENCE.
DID THE SMDP MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS?
THE SMDP DID MORE THAN MEET MY EXPECTATIONS. THE COURSE INSPIRED ME; IT HELPED ME TO BREAKDOWN CERTAIN MENTAL BARRIERS IN MY THINKING AND GAVE ME NEW PERSPECTIVE. IT RAISED MY GAME TO NEW LEVELS AND GAVE ME CONFIDENCE IN MY APPROACH.
INITIALLY I WAS NERVOUS GOING INTO THE LINCOLN PROGRAMME. I DID NOT CONSIDER MYSELF AN "ACADEMIC", SO RESEARCH AND CRITICAL THINKING WORRIED ME. HOWEVER, I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED HOW WELL THE SYSTEM WORKED - I HAD A DIRECT LINE TO MY TUTOR, WHO WAS VERY ATTENTIVE AND SUPPORTIVE. THE COURSE PREPARED ME EFFECTIVELY FOR ALL THE VARIOUS TYPES OF LEARNING REQUIREMENTS, RESEARCH AND WRITING STYLES, IT ENSURED I WAS WELL PREPARED FOR A HIGHER LEARNING DEGREE. THIS COURSE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS; I RECOMMEND IT OFTEN TO VARIOUS FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES.
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE KEY LEARNINGS YOU EXPERIENCED?
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HIGHLIGHTS, DIFFICULT TO NAME THEM ALL. BUT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW: THE ABILITY TO THINK CRITICALLY; THE ABILITY TO RESEARCH AND WRITE ACADEMIC PAPERS; A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC DECISION MAKING; VARIOUS WAYS OF IMPROVING OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS; BUILDING MORE EFFECTIVE TEAMS; A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE IN TERMS OF COMPLEXITY AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT TO SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS. COMPLEX PROBLEM SOLVING THESE ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALL, BUT SOME OF MY MORE ENJOYABLE LEARNINGS.
BOTH ORGANISATIONS HAVE EXCELLENT REPUTATIONS, AND FOR GOOD REASON. THE LECTURERS/TUTORS ARE OF A VERY HIGH STANDARD. SECONDLY, THE WORK-BASED LEARNING APPROACH IS BENEFICIAL TO BOTH LEARNER AND ORGANISATION.
WHERE TO FROM HERE? WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS IN YOUR CAREER?
THE LEARNINGS FROM THE COURSES HAVE ALLOWED ME TO MERGE BUSINESS THINKING, STRATEGY AND MY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. I HAVE SINCE BEEN FULFILLING A CTO/CIO ROLE, BOTH INTERNALLY IN MY CURRENT ORGANISATION, AS WELL AS TO CLIENTS AS AN OUTSOURCED SERVICE. I HAVE INCORPORATED MY LEARNINGS INTO OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, WHICH I BELIEVE HAS RESULTED IN US PROVIDING A UNIQUE SPIN IN THE MARKET COMPARED TO OUR COMPETITORS. I AM AIMING FOR THE MANAGING DIRECTOR ROLE IN OUR BUSINESS IN FUTURE. AS PART OF MY PREPARATION, I INTEND TO BUILD ON MY FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT LEARNINGS BY CONTINUING WITH A FEW FINANCE-BASED SHORT COURSES ARE A NUMBER OF HIGHLIGHTS, DIFFICULT TO NAME THEM ALL. BUT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW: THE ABILITY TO THINK CRITICALLY; THE ABILITY TO RESEARCH AND WRITE ACADEMIC PAPERS; A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC
IN THE SHORT TERM, I AM WORKING HARD AND HOPING TO DOUBLE (OR EVEN TRIPLE) THE SIZE OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS BEFORE LOOKING AT OTHER OPTIONS.

EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY | RESEARCH | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNUNDERSTANDING THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY OF POPULATIONS
THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY RESEARCH GROUP IS A HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE, MULTI-DISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY OF ACADEMICS, POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS, AND POSTDOCTORAL RESEARCHERS. WE AIM TO UNDERSTAND THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY OF POPULATIONS, SPECIES, AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISATION, FROM GENES THROUGH TO ECOSYSTEMS. KEY THEMES WITHIN OUR RESEARCH INCLUDE THE DIVERSIFICATION OF SPECIES OVER TIME, THE RESPONSE OF SPECIES, POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITIES TO GLOBAL CHANGE, AND BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY.
SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS - ECOSYSTEMS COMPRISE A LARGE NUMBER OF FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THEIR MANY COMPONENT ORGANISMS AND THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. WE RELY ON ECOSYSTEMS TO PROVIDE FOOD AND SHELTER. HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND SUCH COMPLEXITY AND HOW DO WE MAKE SUCH SYSTEMS MORE RESILIENT TO THE MANY AND VARIOUS HUMAN IMPACTS? 
STRATEGIES FOR LIFE - ORGANISMS EXHIBIT REMARKABLE DIVERSITY IN HOW THEY GROW, SURVIVE, REPRODUCE AND DIE. UNDERSTANDING THE BEHAVIOURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STRATEGIES THEY USE, HOW THESE STRATEGIES HAVE EVOLVED, AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO CHANGING SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING AND PRESERVING THIS BIODIVERSITY, BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.
THE ARCHITECTURE OF LIFE - PHYSICAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE FITNESS VALUE OF TRAITS AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION. OUR RESEARCH IGNORES DISCIPLINARY BOUNDARIES AND IS LINKED BY THE CENTRAL THEME OF USING PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN BIOLOGY.
PLANT AND ANIMAL DISEASES - DISEASES MATTER  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF THE ECOLOGY OF DISEASE BOTH IN HUMANS AND IN OTHER ORGANISMS AND HIGHLIGHTED THE LINKS BETWEEN OUR OWN DISEASES AND THOSE OF OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS.
ANCIENT LIFE - PALAEOBIOLOGY ADDRESSES LIFES DIVERSITY IN THE DISTANT GEOLOGICAL PAST. WE USE THE FOSSIL RECORD TO UNTANGLE MODELS OF GROUP DIVERSIFICATION, PATTERNS OF TRAIT EVOLUTION OVER TIME, AND THE RESPONSE OF BIOTA TO GLOBAL- AND LOCAL-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AND TO MASS EXTINCTIONS.
A LIST OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY RESEARCH GROUP AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN.
THE GROUP COMPRISES A UNIQUE TEAM OF INTERNATIONALLY-RENOWNED RESEARCHERS WORKING AT THE FOREFRONT OF, AND INTERFACE BETWEEN, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, COGNITION, HEALTH, AND WELFARE.
GROUP RESEARCH FOLLOWS A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY AND HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO INCREASE UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE CHARACTERISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AGEING AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, TO IMPROVE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT.
THE GROUPS VISION IS TO CREATE A STRONG, DYNAMIC, AND ENGAGED RESEARCH CULTURE TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR REAL WORLD IMPACT AT A LOCAL, NATIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.
THE RESEARCH GROUP HAS A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO ANSWERING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE CHARACTERISATION, EVALUATION, AND TESTING OF MICROORGANISMS AND VIRUSES.
CLINICAL ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR RESEARCH FOCUSES ON HOW WE CAN BETTER EVALUATE THE BEHAVIOUR OF ANIMALS IN ORDER TO INTERACT WITH THEM, MANAGE THEM AND TRAIN THEM IN WAYS THAT OPTIMISE THEIR WELLBEING. WE ALSO DEVELOP NEW TREATMENT METHODS FOR HELPING ANIMALS WITH PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR.
THE PSYCHOBIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR DEVELOPED AT LINCOLN PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE EVALUATION OF PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR IN CAPTIVE AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP INDIVIDUALISED TREATMENT PLANS. OUR MSC IN CLINICAL ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR INTRODUCES STUDENTS TO BOTH THE THEORY AND RESEARCH UNDERPINNING THIS THEME. IN ADDITION TO A RANGE OF EXTERNALLY FUNDED PROJECTS WE ALSO ACCEPT A LIMITED NUMBER OF HIGH QUALITY SELF FUNDING PHD APPLICATIONS FROM STUDENTS INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING THEIR RESEARCH SKILLS IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA.
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF CLINICAL ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, WE INVESTIGATE THREE MAIN AREAS:
A POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH DEGREE IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE A TOPIC IN DEPTH, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF ACADEMIC EXPERTS IN YOUR CHOSEN FIELD. WITH EXTENSIVE TRAINING AVAILABLE AND ACCESS TO EXCELLENT FACILITIES, YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CARRY OUT YOUR RESEARCH IN A VIBRANT, SUPPORTIVE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT.
THE KEY TO SUCCESS IN A POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH PROGRAMME IS TO FIND A RESEARCH SUBJECT THAT YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT AND IDENTIFY A SUPERVISORY TEAM THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN THAT AREA. THE FIRST THING THAT ALL PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS SHOULD DO IS DIRECTLY CONTACT A MEMBER OF STAFF THAT THEY FEEL IS BEST ALIGNED WITH THEIR CHOSEN RESEARCH AREA TO DISCUSS THE APPLICATION PROCESS FURTHER.
THE PROJECTS LISTED ON THIS PAGE PROVIDE A SELECTION OF THOSE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN THE SCHOOL ALONG WITH DETAILS OF THE APPROPRIATE ACADEMIC CONTACT, BUT ARE BY NO MEANS COMPREHENSIVE; YOU MAY ALSO WISH TO VISIT THE SCHOOL OF LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH PAGES TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE RESEARCH GOING ON IN THE SUBJECT AREA YOU ARE INTERESTED IN, AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ACADEMIC SUPERVISORS.
THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED PHENOTYPIC VARIATION IN NUMEROUS SPECIES. FOR INSTANCE, SOME SPECIES SHOW A TREND OF DECREASING BODY SIZE DUE TO TEMPERATURE INCREASES, WHILE OTHERS DISPLAY INCREASING ASYMMETRY DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS DURING DEVELOPMENT. THE PHENOMENON OF RANDOM FLUCTUATION FROM BILATERAL SYMMETRY, OR FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO AFFECT BUMBLEBEE WINGS. FOLLOWING EXAMINATION OF MUSEUM SPECIMENS COLLECTED ACROSS BRITAIN DURING THE 20TH CENTURY, ARCE ET AL. (2023) FOUND THAT RELATIVELY WARM AND WET YEARS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER WING ASYMMETRY. THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THESE STUDIES, BY EXAMINING THE DEGREE OF FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY IN BUTTERFLY WINGS FROM MUSEUM SPECIMENS, USING EITHER ONLINE IMAGE REPOSITORIES AT THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM, LONDON, OR NEWLY COLLECTED DATA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT GRAZIELLA IOSSA (GIOSSA@LINCOLN.AC.UK) OR MARCELLO RUTA (MRUTA@LINCOLN.AC.UK).
UNDERSTANDING AND MODELLING THE NANOPARTICLE PROTEIN CORONA
WHEN NANOPARTICLES GET IN CONTACT WITH BIOLOGICAL FLUIDS SUCH AS BLOOD PLASMA, PLASMA PROTEINS INTERACT WITH THE NANOPARTICLES AND FORM A PROTEIN CORONA. NANOPARTICLE-PROTEIN COMPLEXES HAVE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES THAN NAKED NANOPARTICLES, AFFECTING THE FUNCTIONS OF NANOMEDICINES, FOR EXAMPLE ACCUMULATION IN UNINTENDED TISSUES/ORGANS. THEREFORE, ENGINEERED NANOMATERIALS NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BINDING OF PLASMA PROTEINS, BUT THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NANOMATERIALS AND MANY PROTEINS IN PLASMA, SO THE PROBLEM IS COMPLEX AND CURRENTLY UNRESOLVED. PROJECTS IN THIS AREA WILL STUDY THE PROTEIN CORONA TO HELP DESIGNING EFFECTIVE NANOMEDICINES AND CONTRIBUTE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR PHARMACOKINETICS AND NANOTOXICITY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ENRICO FERRARI ATEFERRARI@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OUR BLOGSITE.
EXPLORING THE FUNCTIONAL PROPERTIES OF BIRD NESTS IN AN EVOLUTIONARY FRAMEWORK
BIRD NESTS VARY IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION AND THIS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO RELATE TO THE DEGREE OF THERMAL INSULATION OFFERED BY THE WALLS, TO THE WAY THAT RAINWATER IS ABSORBED, AND TO THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THE STRUCTURE. WHILST DATA ARE AVAILABLE FOR A RELATIVELY WIDE RANGE OF UK BIRD SPECIES, THERE REMAIN A LOT OF SPECIES WHERE VARIABILITY IN NEST COMPOSITION HAS YET TO BE EXPLORED. THE LAB-BASED PROJECT WILL BUILD ON EXISTING STUDIES TO DOCUMENT THE THERMAL, HYDROLOGICAL AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF NESTS FROM PREVIOUSLY UNSTUDIED BIRDS OF INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES. DATA WILL FEED INTO A BROADER STUDY OF THE ECOLOGICAL DRIVERS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF NEST STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION IN EUROPEAN PASSERINES. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT CHARLES DEEMING ATCDEEMING@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
MEASURING THE COSTS OF FLORAL UV PATTERN PRODUCTION
THE FLOWERS OF MANY PLANTS POSSESS UV-ABSORBING ZONES THAT ARE INVISIBLE TO HUMANS BUT VISIBLE TO INSECTS. DUE TO THEIR POSITION, TWO DIFFERENT ROLES HAVE BEEN ASCRIBED TO THESE UV ABSORBING PIGMENTS. FIRST, THEY AID IN POLLINATION AS THEY INCREASE FLOWER ATTRACTIVENESS AND POLLINATION EFFICIENCY. AND SECOND, THEY OFFER PROTECTION TO POLLEN AGAINST THE DETRIMENTAL MUTAGENIC EFFECTS OF UV RADIATION, THEREFORE HAVING LARGE IMPLICATIONS FOR PLANT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER UV PIGMENTATION IS COSTLY TO PRODUCE BY GROWING PLANTS IN SOILS DIFFERING IN NUTRIENT CONTENT AND MEASURING FLORAL UV ABSORPTION AREA AND PLANT PERFORMANCE. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT SANDRA VARGA ATSVARGA@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR CARL SOULSBURY ATCSOULSBURY@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OUR BLOGSITE.
ENZYMES HAVE WIDESPREAD USE IN INDUSTRY (E.G., FOOD, MANUFACTURING, PHARMACEUTICAL) AND MAY BE ALSO USED IN ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS, FOR EXAMPLE IN BIOREMEDIATION. HOWEVER, ENZYMES OPERATE WITHIN A NARROW WINDOW OF CONDITIONS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IMMOBILISED ENZYMES ARE MORE STABLE THAN LOOSE ENZYMES IN A BROADER RANGE OF CONDITIONS, SO IMMOBILISATION MAY BE AN ENABLING SOLUTION FOR INDUSTRY AND ENZYMATIC BIOREMEDIATION. ALSO, IMMOBILISATION ON NANOPARTICLES MAY PRESENT ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS GOOD DIFFUSION IN COMPLEX MATRICES OR POROUS MEDIA (FOR EXAMPLE SOILS). PROJECTS IN THIS AREA WILL DEAL WITH THE SYNTHESIS AND CHARACTERISATION OF ENZYME-NANOPARTICLE COMPLEXES FOR INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BIOTECHNOLOGY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ENRICO FERRARI ATEFERRARI@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OUR BLOGSITE.
DOES MALE SHAPE CORRELATE WITH MALE:FEMALE INTERACTIONS IN THE SMOOTH NEWT (LISSOTRITON VULGARIS)?
THE SMOOTH NEWT EXPRESSES CONSIDERABLE SEXUAL DIMORPHISM DURING THE MATING SEASON WITH MALES DEVELOPING DORSAL CRESTS THAT SEEMS TO BE A FACTOR IN MATE SELECTION. HOWEVER, DEFINING WHAT A FEMALE FINDS ATTRACTIVE HAS RELIED ON LINEAR MEASURES AND BASIC DESCRIPTIONS OF SHAPE AND MAY NOT CAPTURE THE POTENTIALLY COMPLEX FEATURES OF A MALE THAT ARE ATTRACTIVE TO A FEMALE. THIS STUDY WOULD HAVE TWO PARTS  THE FIRST IS TO DEFINE VARIATION IN MALE NEWT SHAPE USING GEOMETRIC MORPHOMETRICS AND THEN TO USE BEHAVIOURAL CHOICE EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FEMALES ARE SELECTING MALES ON THE BASIS OF SIMPLE OR COMPLEX MEASURES OF SHAPE OF REAL MALES OR IMAGES. IN ADDITION, RELATED EXPERIMENTS WILL EXPLORE HOW OLFACTORY CUES ARE IMPORTANT IN MATE CHOICE. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT CHARLES DEEMING ATCDEEMING@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR ANNA WILKINSON ATAWILKINSON@LINCOLN.AC.UK. THIS PROJECT HAS A FEBRUARY START DATE.
ANALYSIS OF THE ANATOMY AND GEOMETRY OF WING MOVEMENT IN BIRDS
BIRD FLIGHT IS CHARACTERISED BY A RANGE OF WINGS SHAPES AND FLIGHT STYLES THAT REFLECT THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE SPECIES CONCERNED. THIS RANGE IS ALSO REFLECTED IN VARIATION IN THE SIZE AND ALIGNMENT OF THE BONES THAT FORM THE PECTORAL GIRDLE, AND IN THE SIZE OF THE FLIGHT MUSCLES. THE PROJECT WILL USE A COMBINATION OF DISSECTION OF A VARIETY OF BIRD SPECIES, WORK WITH SKELETAL SPECIMENS, AND EXISTING PUBLISHED DATA, TO DETERMINE THE BASIC GEOMETRY OF WING MOVEMENT IN BIRDS. AN AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE ANATOMICAL AND FUNCTION FEATURES OF WING MOVEMENT THAT CORRELATE WITH VARIATION IN MORPHOLOGY OF THE PECTORAL GIRDLE AND THE STERNUM. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT DR CHARLES DEEMINGCDEEMING@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR PROF. GREG SUTTONGSUTTON@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON LATERAL FLOW DEVICES. PROJECTS IN THIS AREA WILL DEVELOP BOTH LABORATORY-BASED AND PORTABLE TESTS THAT HARNESS THE PECULIAR OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF GOLD NANOPARTICLES TO DETECT ANALYTES RELIABLY, RAPIDLY AND CHEAPLY. EXAMPLE OF ANALYTES OF INTEREST FOR WHICH PLASMONIC ASSAYS WILL BE DEVELOPED ARE ENDOTOXIN, OTHER BIOMOLECULES OF MICROBIAL ORIGIN, FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS. ENDOTOXIN SENSITIVE DETECTION IS A PARTICULARLY PRESSING PROBLEM, AS IT IS NECESSARY TO REMOVE ALL TRACES OF ENDOTOXIN FROM PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, DUE TO ITS POTENTIALLY FATAL TOXICITY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT ENRICO FERRARI ATEFERRARI@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OUR BLOGSITE.
THE IMPACT OF VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) ON FUNGI-BACTERIA BELOW GROUND INTERACTIONS
BACTERIA AND FUNGI ARE PRESENT IN ALL TYPES OF SOILS, MAKING UP THE TWO MAJOR GROUPS OF MICROORGANISMS IN SOILS AND THEIR INTERACTIONS RANGE FROM MUTUALISTIC TO PARASITISM. DESPITE THEIR ABUNDANCE, HOW FUNGI AND BACTERIA COMMUNICATE IN THE SOIL IS STILL RELATIVELY POORLY UNDERSTOOD. INCREASING EVIDENCE SHOW THAT VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ANTAGONISTIC INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FUNGI AND BACTERIA IN SOILS. THIS PROJECT WILL INVESTIGATE MICROBIAL VOLATILES EMITTED BY SOIL BACTERIA AND FUNGI AND MEASURE THE RESPONSE OF THE PRESENCE OF ONE ORGANISM ON THE OTHER. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT SANDRA VARGA ATSVARGA@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR JOS GONZALEZ-RODRIGUEZ ATJGONZALEZRODRIGUEZ@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OUR BLOGSITE.
PROJECTS ARE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PARASITE INFECTION AND IMMUNE STATUS, FOCUSSING ON BLOOD METRICS FROM INDIVIDUAL MUTE SWANS SAMPLED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS. PROJECTS CAN BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE ECOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DATA COLLECTION IN RELATION TO HEALTH AND PARASITE INFECTION.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACTJENNY DUNNATJDUNN@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR VISIT OURBLOGSITE.ADDITIONAL BENCH FEES MAY BE REQUIRED, DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT.
MULTIPLE PROJECTS ARE AVAILABLE TO ADD TO AND ANALYSE DATASETS OF HOST-PARASITE ASSOCIATIONS IN PASSERINE BIRDS IN LINCOLN, PASSERINE BIRDS IN AFRICA, OR COLUMBIFORME BIRDS IN THE UK AND AFRICA. THESE CAN INCLUDE PROJECTS ON COINFECTION, IMPACTS OF INFECTION, MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISATION OF MOLECULAR LINEAGES, DRIVERS OF INFECTION PREVALENCE, AMONG OTHERS (SEE OUR BLOGSITEFOR MORE IDEAS AND PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS); ADDITIONAL BENCH FEES MAY BE REQUIRED, DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT. PLEASE CONTACT JENNY DUNN JDUNN@LINCOLN.AC.UKFOR MORE INFORMATION.
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT SOME FLY SPECIES PERCEIVE COLOURS AS FALLING INTO ONE OF FOUR DISCRETE CATEGORIES; TWO COLOURS THAT FALL IN THE SAME COLOUR CATEGORY WOULD THEREFORE BE PREDICTED TO BE INDISTINGUISHABLE. HOWEVER, THERE IS STILL A LOT WE DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS SYSTEM: FOR EXAMPLE, AT LEAST ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES HAS ONLY BEEN HYPOTHESISED AND THERE IS NOT (AS YET) ANY EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT IT; MOREOVER, IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER FLIES ARE ABLE PERCEIVE SOME COLOUR VARIATION WITHIN A CATEGORY, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR CATEGORICAL COLOUR VISION IS CONTEXT-DEPENDENT (THE EXISTING EVIDENCE IS ALMOST ENTIRELY BASED ON FORAGING TASKS, FOR INSTANCE), OR HOW WIDESPREAD CATEGORICAL COLOUR VISION IS. THIS PROJECT WOULD EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS BY RUNNING PSYCHOPHYSICAL STUDIES (I.E., THOSE LOOKING AT BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSES TO PHYSICAL CHANGES IN VISUAL STIMULI) ON A VARIETY OF WILD AND CAPTIVE FLY SPECIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT TOM PIKE ATTPIKE@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
UNDERSTANDING THE REGULATION OF MYOSIN VI AND ITS ROLE IN DISEASE
MYOSINS ARE MOTOR PROTEINS THAT TRANSPORT CARGO WITHIN OUR CELLS AND MAINTAIN THE MORPHOLOGY OF CELLULAR STRUCTURES BY INTERACTING WITH THE ACTIN CYTOSKELETON. MYOSIN VI IS A MYOSIN WITH UNIQUE PROPERTIES THAT IS INVOLVED IN MANY VITAL CELLULAR PROCESSES. THEREFORE, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT MYOSIN VI HAS BEEN LINKED TO VARIOUS PATHOLOGIES, INCLUDING AGGRESSIVE CANCERS. TO PERFORM ITS MULTIPLE ROLES, MVI NEEDS TO BE TIGHTLY REGULATED BY VARIOUS MECHANISMS THAT ENSURE THAT MVI IS ACTIVATED AT THE RIGHT TIME AND CELLULAR LOCATION. VARIOUS PROJECTS ARE IN OFFER THAT AIM TO EXPLORE THE UNSOLVED ASPECTS OF MYOSIN VI REGULATION AND HOW THESE CONTRIBUTE TO PATHOLOGY. THE RESEARCH WILL INVOLVE A COMBINATION OF MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY, PROTEIN BIOCHEMISTRY AND FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY, AND THE PROJECTS COULD BE TAILORED BASED ON YOUR INTERESTS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT NATALI FILI ATNFILI@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
THE EVOLUTION OF THE BRAIN HAS ATTRACTED CONSIDERABLE SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE RELIED ON INTER-SPECIFIC OR INTER-POPULATION COMPARISONS, LOOKING FOR CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BRAIN ARCHITECTURE AND FITNESS-RELATED TRAITS. MUCH LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD IS THE PLASTICITY OF THE BRAIN WITHIN POPULATIONS, AND SPECIFICALLY HOW VARIATION IN BRAIN STRUCTURE IMPACTS AN INDIVIDUALS BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES, AND HOW (AND WHY) THE STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN CHANGES OVER TIME. THIS PROJECT WOULD INVESTIGATE THIS BY NON-INVASIVELY QUANTIFYING TEMPORAL VARIATION IN THE BRAIN STRUCTURE OF INDIVIDUAL FISH AND RELATING THIS TO THEIR PERFORMANCE IN BEHAVIOURAL AND COGNITIVE TASKS. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT TOM PIKE ATTPIKE@LINCOLN.AC.UKOR ANNA WILKINSON ATAWILKINSON@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
WHILE INVISIBLE TO HUMANS, FOR MANY SPECIES THE POLARISATION OF LIGHT IS NOT ONLY DETECTABLE BUT CAN PROVIDE PERTINENT VISUAL INFORMATION. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PATTERNS OF POLARISATION COULD BE USED (IN A SIMILAR WAY TO PATTERNS OF COLOUR) FOR TASKS SUCH AS CAMOUFLAGE BREAKING, PREY DETECTION, AND SOCIAL COMMUNICATION. HOWEVER, WE STILL HAVE A REMARKABLY POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF POLARISATION VISION. THIS PROJECT WOULD EXPLORE POLARISATION-SENSITIVE VISION IN FISH, USING BEHAVIOURAL TESTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY CAN DETECT POLARISED LIGHT, HOW ACUTE THEIR POLARISATION VISION IS, AND WHETHER POLARISED SIGNALS CAN BE USED IN INTRA-SPECIFIC COMMUNICATION. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT TOM PIKE ATTPIKE@LINCOLN.AC.UK.

TEACHING IS UNDERPINNED BY THE RESEARCH EXPERTISE OF OUR ACADEMIC STAFF, A NUMBER OF WHOM ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS.
ANIMAL WELFARE IS A GROWING SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE REFLECTING CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC CONCERN. OUR RESEARCH IN ANIMAL WELFARE IS LED BY A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS, WHO WORK WITH A VARIETY OF ANIMALS INCLUDING LABORATORY, FARM, COMPANION, AND ZOO ANIMALS.
OUR WORK ADDRESSES FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL OBSERVATIONAL, EXPERIMENTAL, AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS TO MEASURE AND UNDERSTAND ANIMAL WELFARE AND ASSOCIATED EMOTIONAL OR AFFECTIVE STATES. OUR WORK ALSO APPLIES THESE METHODS TO DETERMINE HOW TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF ANIMALS.
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ANIMAL WELFARE ASSESSMENT, WE INVESTIGATE TWO MAIN AREAS:
WE HAVE A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO ANSWERING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE CHARACTERISATION, EVALUATION AND TESTING OF MICROORGANISMS AND VIRUSES. THIS COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE, INVESTIGATING THE ACTIVITY OF NEW ANTIMICROBIALS OR DEFINING THE STRUCTURE OF BACTERIAL PROTEINS. STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY IS AN IMPORTANT TOOL WE USE TO INVESTIGATE THE 3-D STRUCTURES OF BIOMOLECULES AND EXPLAIN BIOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS. THE FIGURE BELOW SHOWS SOME OF THE KEY STEPS FOR AN X-RAY CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC STUDY USED TO SOLVE THE PROTEIN STRUCTURE OF A BACTERIAL CELL WALL RE- STRUCTURING ENZYME FROM BACILLUS ANTHRACIS. (A) X-RAY DIFFRACTION PATTERN (B) AND (C) STRUCTURE OF THE RE- STRUCTURING ENZYME KNOWN AS AN AUTOLYSIN.
WE HAVE A WIDE RANGE OF EXPERTISE FOCUSSED ON USING LIVING SYSTEMS AND ORGANISMS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS. OUR RESEARCH UTILISES MANY TECHNIQUES, FROM PROTEIN BIOCHEMISTRY AND STRUCTURAL TECHNIQUES TO CELL CULTURE AND BIO-CONJUGATION. WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW METHODS TO DESIGN BIO-THERAPEUTICS AND WE ARE ASSESSING AND DEVELOPING NOVEL DELIVERY STRATEGIES.THE GROUP HAS DEVELOPED STRONG COLLABORATIONS ACROSS THE COLLEGE OF HEALTH AND SCIENCE, THE LINCOLN INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH, THE LINCOLN INSTITUTE FOR AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY AND THE COLLEGE OF ARTS, SOCIAL SCIENCESAND HUMANTIES.
EXPLORING THE CAUSES, FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, AND THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON WELFARE.
INCREASING UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASE CHARACTERISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH AGEING AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, TO IMPROVE PREVENTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND TREATMENT.
GENERATING INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN THE AREA OF DIABETES AND RELATED CARDIO METABOLIC AND ASSOCIATED INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS.
EXPLORING THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY OF POPULATIONS, SPECIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL ORGANISATION, FROM GENES THROUGH TO ECOSYSTEMS.
ANSWERING FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THE CHARACTERISATION, EVALUATION AND TESTING OF MICROORGANISMS AND VIRUSES.
STUDIES OF EXTINCT ORGANISMS ARE KEY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LIFES ORIGIN AND DIVERSIFICATION. THE FOSSIL RECORD PROVIDES UNIQUE AND FUNDAMENTAL INFORMATION ON PAST BIODIVERSITY. IT REVEALS HOW STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ORGANISMS ARE SELECTED FOR AND MODIFIED OVER GEOLOGICAL TIME. IT ALSO OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO THE RESPONSE OF ORGANISMS TO LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES, SUCH AS MASS EXTINCTIONS. WE INVESTIGATE A DIVERSE RANGE OF GROUPS, INCLUDING SINGLE-CELLED ORGANISMS, INSECTS, EARLY LIMBED VERTEBRATES, MESOZOIC MARINE AND FLYING REPTILES, DINOSAURS, AND BIRDS. OUR RESEARCH IS INTRINSICALLY CROSS-DISCIPLINARY, AND WE REGULARLY INTERACT WITH OTHER RESEARCH GROUPS IN LINCOLN AND WITH A WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGISTS.
WE ARE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THE LINKS BETWEEN SPECIES RICHNESS, MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY, AND STRUCTURAL COMPLEXITY. OUR RESEARCH ASKS HOW THESE VARIABLES HAVE SHAPED BIODIVERSITY OVER TIME. TO THIS END, WE INVESTIGATE MODELS OF TRAIT EVOLUTION IN RESPONSE TO ECOLOGICAL INNOVATION (E.G. CONQUEST OF NEW HABITATS) AND FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATION (E.G. CHANGES IN BITE FORCE; FLIGHT PERFORMANCE). AS A RECENT ADDITION TO OUR RESEARCH PROGRAMME, THE ANALYSIS OF SKELETAL COMPLEXITY SEEKS TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR THE SO-CALLED FIRST LAW OF BIOLOGICAL EVOLUTION, NAMELY THAT COMPLEXITY TENDS TO INCREASE IN PARALLEL LINEAGES OF ORGANISMS OVER TIME.
THE EVOLUTION OF VERTEBRATE TERRESTRIALITY IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF A MAJOR RADIATION UNDERPINNED BY PROFOUND ANATOMICAL, BIOMECHANICAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. OUR GROUP EXPLORES THE EXTRAORDINARY VARIETY OF BODY SHAPES AND PROPORTIONS THAT EVOLVED SOON AFTER VERTEBRATES LEFT THE WATER TO INVADE THE LAND. RESEARCH IN OTHER AREAS AIMS TO UNCOVER CHANGES IN SENSORY PERCEPTION (E.G. INSECT ACOUSTIC COMMUNICATION) IN RESPONSE TO THE OPENING OF NEW ENVIRONMENT (E.G. SPREAD AND FRAGMENTATION OF FOREST HABITATS) AND THE APPEARANCE OF NEW PREDATORY GUILDS (E.G. FROM AMONG VERTEBRATES).
USING DATA FROM LIVING ORGANISMS, IT IS POSSIBLE TO MAKE INFERENCES ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF THE BIOLOGY OF EXTINCT LIFE FORMS. THE ECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY OF FOSSIL ORGANISMS ARE TWO KEY AREAS THAT OUR GROUP INVESTIGATES. FOR EXAMPLE, BIRD EGGS CAN TELL US INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT DINOSAUR REPRODUCTION AND DATA FROM LARGE MODERN VERTEBRATES, SUCH AS ELEPHANTS, CAN INFORM US ABOUT PLAUSIBLE BIOLOGIES FOR EXTINCT MEGAHERBIVORES, SUCH AS THE ICONIC, LONG-NECKED, AND OFTEN GIGANTIC SAUROPOD DINOSAURS.

GAME DRIVES AROUND THE RESERVE
THE DEPARTMENT OF LIFE SCIENCES CURRENTLY RUNS AN OPTIONAL FIELD COURSE MODULE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.THIS PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO RESEARCH IN A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT AND TO STUDY LOCAL PLANTS AND ANIMALS. MANY OF THE LOCATIONS VISITED ARE BIODIVERSITY HOT SPOTS WITH A VARIETY OF ANIMALS, BIRDS, INSECTS, AND PLANTS TO STUDY, PROVIDING STUDENTS WITH THE CHANCE TO EXPERIENCE SPECIES THEY MAY NOT HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENCOUNTERED. EACH OF THE EXCURSIONS OFFER OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPLORE THE LOCAL AREA AND EXPERIENCE A NEW CULTURE.
STUDENTS AND STAFF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF LIFE SCIENCES HAVE PREVIOUSLY VISITED MOLISE, ITALY; THE SITE IS LOCATED IN THE ITALIAN CENTRAL APENNINES. DURING THEIR TIME IN ITALY STUDENTS LEARNT MORE ABOUT WILDLIFE IDENTIFICATION, FIELD ECOLOGY TECHNIQUES, AND PROJECT DESIGN, WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON FIELD DATA COLLECTION. 
THESE FIELD COURSES ARE AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN VALUABLE FIELD STUDY EXPERIENCE AND PRACTICAL SKILLS, WHICH MAY ENHANCE YOUR EMPLOYABILITY AND CAN BOOST YOUR CV. WORKING ON PROJECTS WITH OTHER STUDENTS AND TACKLING CHALLENGES CAN ENABLE YOU TO DEVELOP YOUR PROBLEM SOLVING AND TRANSFERABLE SKILLS AND GAIN CONFIDENCE. LECTURERS FROM ACROSS THEDEPARTMENT OF LIFE SCIENCES TAKE PART IN THE TRIP, PROVIDING YOU WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM A RANGE OF EXPERTS.
STUDENTS CAN LEARN ABOUT THE ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION OF THE AREA. BEFORE THE TRIP STUDENTS WRITE A PROJECT PROPOSAL TO DEVELOP THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCATION AND ITS WILDLIFE. ON EACH TRIP STUDENTS ARE INTRODUCED TO LOCAL FLORA AND FAUNA, PRESENT A GROUP PROJECT, COMPLETE AN IDENTIFICATION TEST OF PLANTS, VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES, WORK ON AN ALLOCATED PROJECT, AND WRITE A REPORT ON THEIR PROJECT. PROJECTS CAN RANGE FROM ECOLOGY, ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, AND PLANT ECOLOGY TO THE STUDY OF ANTIMICROBIAL COMPOUNDS. THE TRIPS CAN TAKE PLACE IN THE SUMMER BEFORE THE START OF THE FINAL YEAR OF YOUR DEGREE. THE FIELD TRIPS LAST FOR APPROXIMATELY 8-10 NIGHTS.
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE OVERSEAS FIELD COURSE MODULE, AND LOOK AT PREVIOUS TRIPS TO CLOUD FOREST, ECUADOR, ON OURBLOG.
OPTIONAL FIELD TRIPS MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, INCLUDING FLIGHTS. STUDENTS MAY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR OVERNIGHT STAYS, LOCAL TRAVEL, AND FOOD CLOSE TO THE DESTINATION IF THEIR FLIGHTS ARRIVE THE DAY BEFORE THE TEAM ARE SCHEDULED TO MEET. STUDENTS MAY BRING PERSONAL ITEMS OF CLOTHING AND TRAVEL EQUIPMENT, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE SPECIALISED FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THEY ARE TRAVELLING TO, AND RECOMMENDED MEDICINES AND TRAVEL TOILETRIES SUCH AS ANTI-MALARIA MEDICATION, VACCINATIONS, INSECT REPELLENT AND SUNSCREEN. THESE COSTS WILL DEPEND ON WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO BRING.

WE COUPLE OUR STRENGTHS IN COGNITIVE BIOLOGY, CLINICAL ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, AND ANIMAL HEALTH AND DISEASE WITH RESEARCH APPROACHES FROM THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, AS WE RECOGNISE THAT TRANSLATING THE FINDINGS FROM OUR FOUNDATIONAL AND APPLIED ANIMAL RESEARCH INTO REAL-WORLD IMPACT WILL INEVITABLY INVOLVE ADDRESSING THE HUMAN AND SOCIETAL FACTORS.
TO THIS END, MEMBERS OF OUR RESEARCH GROUP WORK WITH OTHERS ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY, NATION, AND WORLD TO EXPLORE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THINK, INTERPRET, AND MAKE DECISIONS AROUND ANIMAL CARE, USE AND WELFARE, WITH AN AIM TO UNCOVER THE BARRIERS FACED BY INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS AND CO-DEVELOP SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN IMPLEMENTING EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTISES. OUR RESEARCH IN THIS AREA USES A MIX OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGIES AND SPANS CONTEXTS (E.G., LIVESTOCK, COMPANION AND EXOTIC ANIMALS) AND STAKEHOLDER GROUPS (E.G., FARMERS, VETERINARIANS, COMPANION ANIMAL OWNERS, THOSE INVOLVED IN ANIMAL ASSISTED INTERVENTIONS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC). RECENT PROJECTS HAVE INCLUDED:
ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPRISED OF A LARGE NUMBER OF FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THEIR MANY COMPONENT ORGANISMS AND THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. HOW CAN WE UNDERSTAND SUCH COMPLEXITY AND HOW DO WE MAKE SUCH SYSTEMS MORE RESILIENT TO THE MANY AND VARIOUS HUMAN IMPACTS?
ECOSYSTEMS ON OUR PLANET ARE NOT ONLY HOME FOR DIVERSE LIFE FORMS AND POWERHOUSE OF CLIMATE REGULATIONS, BUT ALSO SOURCE OF CRITICAL SOCIETAL NEEDS, FOR FOOD, MATERIALS, MEDICINE, ENERGY, ARTS, CULTURE AND ENTERTAINMENT. OUR INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK APPLIES RAPIDLY ADVANCING ECOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDINGS TO A RANGE OF NATURAL AND HUMAN MODIFIED LANDSCAPES, FROM TROPICAL RAINFORESTS TO THE UK AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES, TO ENABLE BETTER ACTIONS THAT OPTIMISE LANDSCAPE MULTIFUNCTIONALITY, BALANCING NATURE CONSERVATION AND SOCIETAL DEMANDS.
ANTIBIOTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT
ANTIBIOTICS AND OTHER ANTIMICROBIALS ARE OFTEN DERIVED FROM SOIL MICROORGANISMS. THE INDISCRIMINATE RELEASE OF THOSE CHEMICALS IN THE ENVIRONMENTS CAN AFFECT THE FUNCTIONING AND HEALTH OF ECOSYSTEMS AND HUMAN HEALTH. WE ARE STUDYING THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON ECOSYSTEMS AND IN TURN, HUMAN HEALTH THIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM, AND WE ARE TAKING A GLOBAL APPROACH WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES IN SOUTH AMERICA AND CHINA.
PEST INSECTS ARE ONE OF THE GREATEST THREATS TO FOOD PRODUCTION, CAUSING OVER 20% OF THE WORLDS TOTAL CROP DAMAGE EACH YEAR, WITH NEW AND EMERGING PESTS CAUSING DISTINCT PROBLEMS ACROSS THE PLANET. THE EXTENSIVE USE OF CHEMICAL PESTICIDES CAUSES ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION, RISKS TO HUMAN HEALTH, NON-TARGET EFFECTS ON NATURAL ENEMIES AND DEVELOPMENT OF PESTICIDE RESISTANCE. BIOLOGICAL CONTROL PROGRAMMES, WHERE NATURAL ENEMIES OR MICROBIAL BAITS ARE HARNESSED TO CONTROL INSECT PESTS, OFFER A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UK AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE DEVELOPMENT BOARD AND COLLEAGUES IN THE UK AND AUSTRALIA WE INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF MICROBES AND DISEASES IN THE CONTROL OF MAJOR GLOBAL CROP PESTS.
PLANTS ARE CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TO A RANGE OF FUNGI AND BACTERIA, BOTH ABOVE- AND BELOWGROUND. THESE INTERACTIONS CAN RANGE FROM BENEFICIAL TO PATHOGENIC. WE ARE INVESTIGATING THE PATTERNS AND PROCESSES DETERMINING PLANT-MICROBIAL ASSOCIATIONS AND THE ROLE THESE INTERACTIONS PLAY IN ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS.
WE ALL NEED TO EAT, BUT THE INTENSIVE HIGH-INPUT AGRICULTURAL METHODS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST 80 YEARS HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL ON THE ENVIRONMENT. A MYRIAD MICROSCOPIC BACTERIAL, FUNGAL AND INVERTEBRATE COMMUNITIES UNDERPIN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND UNDERSTANDING THESE COMMUNITIES BETTER MAY HOLD THE KEY TO DEVELOPING MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION METHODS. PART OF THE RESEARCH GROUP WORK WITH AN ARRAY OF OTHER ACADEMICS AND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR RESEARCHERS TO DESCRIBE THE UNSEEN BIODIVERSITY IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS AND TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS AGRICULTURAL PRACTISES ON THESE.

ORGANISMS EXHIBIT REMARKABLE DIVERSITY IN HOW THEY GROW, SURVIVE, REPRODUCE AND DIE. UNDERSTANDING THE BEHAVIOURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STRATEGIES THEY USE, HOW THESE STRATEGIES HAVE EVOLVED, AND HOW THEY RESPOND TO CHANGING SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IS KEY TO UNDERSTANDING AND PRESERVING THIS BIODIVERSITY, BOTH NOW AND IN THE FUTURE.
SEXUAL SELECTION IS THE PROCESS WHEREBY INDIVIDUALS OF EITHER SEX COMPETE TO REPRODUCE. WITHIN THIS TOPIC, WE INVESTIGATE HOW (AND WHY) ANIMALS SIGNAL (VISUALLY, ACOUSTICALLY, AND CHEMICALLY) TO PROSPECTIVE MATES, HOW THESE SIGNALS EVOLVED, AND HOW INDIVIDUALS COMPETE FOR ACCESS TO REPRODUCTION BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER MATING.
WHAT DRIVES THE EVOLUTION OF REPRODUCTIVE TRAITS IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS? WE INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISMS MALES AND FEMALES USE TO MAXIMISE THEIR REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS, THEIR ADAPTATIONS TO DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS, AND PLASTICITY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE.
AGEING AND THE PACE OF LIFE
LIFESPAN VARIES WIDELY IN NATURE, WITH SOME ORGANISMS ADOPTING A LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG STRATEGY, WHILE OTHERS LIVE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. EVEN WITHIN A LIFESPAN, THE SUCCESS WITH WHICH ORGANISMS REPRODUCE AND REPAIR THEMSELVES DECLINES WITH AGE, KNOWN AS SENESCENCE. BUT WHAT CONTROLS HOW ORGANISMS AGE? WE STUDY THIS BOTH EXPERIMENTALLY WITHIN MODEL ORGANISMS, AND COMPUTATIONALLY ACROSS THE TREE OF LIFE.
WE ARE A UNIQUE TEAM OF INTERNATIONALLY-RENOWNED RESEARCHERS WORKING AT THE FOREFRONT OF, AND INTERFACE BETWEEN LIFE, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, COMPUTING AND SOCIAL SCIENCES.
OUR CROSS-DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH BENEFITS FROM STRONG LINKS WITH MEMBERS OF THESCHOOL OF PSYCHOLOGYAND THE SCHOOL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, AS WELL AS OTHER RESEARCH GROUPS WITHIN THE SCHOOL OF LIFE & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PARTICULARLY THE EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY GROUP AND THE LINCOLN INSTITUTE FOR AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY.
WE COLLABORATE IN OUR PURSUIT OF EXCELLENCE, WITH MULTIDISCIPLINARITY AT THE HEART OF MUCH OF WHAT WE DO. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHERS INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY (NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY) INCLUDING OTHER LEADING UNIVERSITIES, CHARITIES, GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS AND BUSINESSES.
IN ADDITION, WE OFFER EXTERNAL CONSULTANCY AND CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT COURSES TO THOSE WISHING TO WORK WITH LEADING AUTHORITIES IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, COGNITION, HEALTH AND WELFARE. THIS INCLUDES MEMBERS OF THE ANIMAL CARE AND PET FOOD INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS, VETERINARY PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, TELEVISION AND OTHER MEDIA AS WELL AS CLINICAL BEHAVIOUR SERVICES.
WE CHALLENGE THE STATUS QUO IN ORDER TO EXPLORE AND IDENTIFY NEW, INCLUSIVE AND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS COMPLEX CONTEMPORARY ISSUES OF REGIONAL, NATIONAL AND GLOBAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS INCLUDES A FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THEUNITED NATIONS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS IN OUR RESEARCH. 
THE ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, COGNITION AND WELFARE RESEARCH GROUP USES A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO GENERATE AND TRANSLATE FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROVIDING INNOVATIVE, PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY, INCLUDING FOR ALL ANIMAL SPECIES WITH WHICH WE INTERACT.
OUR VISION IS TO BE A TRANSFORMATIVE FORCE FOR GOOD WITHIN SOCIETY, ENABLING EXCELLENT HEALTH, WELFARE AND PROSPERITY WITHIN AN INTER-CONNECTED AND COMPLEX WORLD.
OUR LONG-TERM AMBITION IS TO MAINTAIN AND GROW OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION FOR RESEARCH EXCELLENCE RELATING TO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, COGNITION, HEALTH AND WELFARE.
AS A CIVIC UNIVERSITY, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARTICULATE OUR VALUES AS THEY REFLECT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE STAND FOR. OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES ARE:
WE ACCEPT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WELLBEING OF PEOPLE, OUR COMMUNITY, THE ENVIRONMENT AND ANIMALS WITH WHOM WE CO-EXIST. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MORALLY RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH AND THE PROMOTION OF ETHICAL PRACTICES. 
WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHALLENGE EACH OTHER RESPECTFULLY IN ORDER TO EXPAND THE BOUNDARIES OF SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING AND MAINTAIN RIGOROUS STANDARDS.
WE PRIORITISE INCLUSIVE PRACTICES IN ALL OUR WORK, EMBRACING DIFFERENCE THROUGH A GLOBAL MINDSET THAT RECOGNISES THE VALUE AND INCLUSIVE BENEFIT OF DIVERSITY, ESPECIALLY IN RELATION TO GAINING GREATER INSIGHT INTO COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND THEIR SOLUTIONS.
WE STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE IN EVERYTHING WE DO, HOLDING HIGH EXPECTATIONS OF OUR PERFORMANCE AND THE IMPACT OF OUR RESEARCH. THIS IS ENABLED BY OUR EXCELLENT FACILITIES WHICH INCLUDE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED BEHAVIOUR, PERCEPTION AND COGNITION LABORATORIES FOR VERTEBRATE AND INVERTEBRATE SPECIES, THE UNIVERSITY FARM AND RELATED RESEARCH FACILITIES AT RISEHOLME.
ANIMAL WELFARE IS A GROWING SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINE REFLECTING CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC CONCERN. OUR RESEARCH IN ANIMAL WELFARE IS LED BY A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS, WHO WORK WITH A VARIETY OF ANIMALS INCLUDING LABORATORY, FARM, COMPANION, AND ZOO ANIMALS. 
ANIMALS ARE UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURES FROM DISEASE, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND HUMAN ACTIVITY. WHEN ANIMALS ARE UNABLE TO OVERCOME THESE PRESSURES, THEIR WELFARE SUFFERS. AT LINCOLN, WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF COMPANION, FARMED, AND WILD ANIMALS OF ALL TYPES. 
WELCOME TO ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR AT LINCOLN, FROM THIS PAGE YOU CAN ACCESS A RANGE OF BEHAVIOUR RELATED RESOURCES. THE ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR CLINIC WEBSITE IS WHERE ALL INFORMATION AND RELEVANT ONLINE FORMS CAN BE FOUND (OWNER AND VET) TO FACILITATE A BEHAVIOUR REFERRAL.
THE CLINIC CARRIES OUT INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED RESEARCH ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF SPECIES. PET OWNERS CAN FIND OUT ABOUT HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOME OF THIS RESEARCH VIA THE PETS CAN DO WEBSITE.
THE CLINIC IS STILL OPEN AND WE ARE OFFERING REMOTE CONSULTATIONS AS WELL AS FOLLOW-UP BY VIDEO CALL, TELEPHONE, AND E-MAIL AS APPROPRIATE.
WE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS PAPERWORK SENT IN ELECTRONICALLY FOR THE TIME BEING.
IF YOU ARE A PET OWNER, WE ARE ABLE TO OFFER AN INITIAL CONSULTATION VIA MICROSOFT 365 TEAMS OR OTHER VIRTUAL MEETING PACKAGES. THE CONSULTATION WILL INVOLVE EXPANSION OF THE HISTORY FORM SUBMITTED, AN IN-DEPTH BEHAVIOUR ASSESSMENT, TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MOVING FORWARDS, AND UP TO THREE MONTHS OF FOLLOW UP SUPPORT. THIS MAY BE LIMITED TO MANAGEMENT ADVICE IN SOME CASES.
DUE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO PERFORM A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION (WHERE OUR VETERINARY BEHAVIOURISTS MAY OTHERWISE HAVE DONE SO), IN SOME CASES WE MAY ASK YOU TO SEND US ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, POSSIBLY INCLUDING VIDEO FOOTAGE OF YOUR PET (IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO). IF WE FEEL THIS IS NECESSARY, WE WILL DISCUSS THE DETAILS WITH YOU AS IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE SAFETY AND WELFARE OF ALL. THEREFORE, PLEASE DO NOT PUT YOURSELF OR OTHER PETS AT RISK TRYING TO COLLECT FOOTAGE OF PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR.

SOCIALITY, UNDERSTOOD AS THE FORMATION OF EITHER TRANSIENT OR PERMANENT ASSOCIATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN OR DIFFERENT SPECIES, IS PREVALENT ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF VERTEBRATE AND INVERTEBRATE TAXA. WHEREAS SOME FEATURES OF SOCIAL LIVES ARE UNIQUE TO ONE SPECIES - OR EVEN ONE SINGLE POPULATION, AND THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND DIVERSITY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOURS VARY GREATLY WITHIN AND AMONG TAXONOMIC GROUPS, ALL ANIMALS LIVING IN GROUPS FACE THE CHALLENGE OF RESPONDING TO THEIR HABITATS AND ALSO NAVIGATING THEIR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT.
OUR RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE RICHNESS AND DYNAMISM OF ANIMALS SOCIO-EMOTIONAL CAPACITIES IN A DIVERSITY OF ANIMAL SPECIES USING A RANGE OF THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES. OUR GOAL IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ECOLOGICAL, SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL FACTORS INFLUENCING INDIVIDUALS SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND PLASTICITY, WHICH CAN IN TURN UNDERPIN ADVANCES IN THE WELFARE AND MANAGEMENT OF BOTH CAPTIVE AND WILD ANIMAL POPULATIONS.
WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ANIMAL SOCIALITY, WE INVESTIGATE TWO MAIN AREAS:

DISEASES MATTER  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF THE ECOLOGY OF DISEASE BOTH IN HUMANS AND IN OTHER ORGANISMS AND HIGHLIGHTED THE LINKS BETWEEN OUR OWN DISEASES AND THOSE OF OTHER ANIMALS AND PLANTS.
SUB-CLINICAL IMPACTS OF PARASITIC INFECTION ARE OF GROWING CONCERN. USING AVIAN SYSTEMS WE STUDY THE INFLUENCE OF VECTOR BEHAVIOUR ON PARASITE TRANSMISSION, ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARASITISM AND BEHAVIOUR (INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOURAL SYNDROMES, OR PERSONALITY TYPES), AND THE IMPLICATIONS THESE MAY HAVE FOR POPULATIONS ACROSS GENERATIONS THROUGH DELAYED LIFE-HISTORY EFFECTS. WE ALSO CONSIDER HOW MULTIPLE STRESS FACTORS (E.G. FOOD QUALITY/LIMITATION, PARASITE INFECTION, COINFECTION, PREDATOR ABUNDANCE) INTERACT IN WILD POPULATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN DECLINE, AND THE IMPLICATIONS THESE INTERACTIONS HAVE FOR THE CONSERVATION OF POPULATIONS.
MANY FACTORS CAN IMPACT THE OUTCOME OF INFECTIONS, BUT THE ROLE OF NUTRITION IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY RECOGNISED. IN HUMANS, PROTEIN MALNUTRITION IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY DUE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND OVER-NUTRITION MAY IMPAIR IMMUNE FUNCTION. ANIMALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CHANGE THEIR DIETS WHEN INFECTED TO IMPROVE THE OUTCOME OF INFECTION, KNOWN AS SELF-MEDICATION. WE STUDY HOW INTRINSIC (E.G. AGE, SEX, NUTRITIONAL STATUS) AND EXTRINSIC FACTORS (E.G. PATHOGEN RISK, POPULATION DENSITY) SIMULTANEOUSLY SHAPE THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HOSTS AND THEIR PARASITES.
VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE COGNITIVE ABILITIES OF REPTILES. THEY HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE SLUGGISH AND UNINTELLIGENT CREATURES (YERKES, 1901) AND HAVE LARGELY BEEN IGNORED IN THE STUDY OF ANIMAL COGNITION.
HOWEVER, TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION OF COGNITION IN AMNIOTES, IT IS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT RESEARCH INTO THE LEARNING AND MEMORY ABILITIES OF REPTILES THAT PARALLEL THE EXTENSIVE WORK ALREADY AVAILABLE IN MAMMALS AND BIRDS. OUR RESEARCH HAS REVEALED THAT REPTILES POSSESS AN IMPRESSIVE SUITE OF COGNITIVE ABILITIES FROM COMPLEX SOCIAL LEARNING (E.G. KIS ET AL.,2015) TO EXTENSIVE LONG-TERM MEMORY (E.G. SOLDATI ET AL.,2017). THEY CAN EVEN USE A TOUCHSCREEN!
ANIMALS ARE USED TO HELP HUMANS IN ALL SORTS OF TASKS, FROM EXPLOSIVE DETECTION TO SEARCH AND RESCUE. THE WORKING ANIMAL COGNITION GROUP USES CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF WORKING ANIMALS. WE INVESTIGATE A RANGE OF AREAS, FROM NOVEL TRAINING TECHNIQUES TO TO THE IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES ON PERFORMANCE.
THIS RESEARCH TAKES OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ANIMAL COGNITION AND USES IT TO SOLVE REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS.
THE ARCHITECTURE OF LIFE | EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNOUR RESEARCH
ALTHOUGH ORGANISMS OBEY THE SAME PHYSICAL LAWS AS INANIMATE OBJECTS THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF THESE LAWS ARE OFTEN NEGLECTED. PHYSICAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THE FITNESS VALUE OF TRAITS AND PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE COURSE OF EVOLUTION. OUR RESEARCH IGNORES DISCIPLINARY BOUNDARIES AND IS LINKED BY THE CENTRAL THEME OF USING PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES AS A WAY OF UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX PROBLEMS IN BIOLOGY. OUR WORK IS CHARACTERIZED BY STRONG INTERDISCIPLINARY, COLLABORATIVE LINKS ACROSS ACADEMIC AREAS IN THE UNIVERSITY, AND BY NOVEL APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING QUESTIONS AT THE INTERFACE BETWEEN BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS.
JUMPING INSECTS PROVIDE SPECTACULAR EXAMPLES OF PRECISELY MANIPULATED SPEED, SPIN, ENERGY AND POWER. IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, JUMPING INSECTS CATAPULT THEMSELVES TOWARD TARGETS AND AWAY FROM PREDATORS. WE STUDY THE MECHANICS OF HOW VARIOUS INSECTS CONTROL THE MUSCLES, JOINTS, AND EVEN SPRINGS, THAT THEY USE TO FLING THEMSELVES THROUGH THE AIR. OUR RESEARCH IS BALLISTIC PHYSICS APPLIED TO LIVING BEINGS AT HIGH VELOCITIES.
HOW ANIMALS HEAR, SEE, SMELL AND TASTE THE WORLD AROUND THEM IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF THEIR BEHAVIOUR, AND UNDERPINS HOW THEY RESPOND TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. WE INVESTIGATE THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF ANIMAL SENSORY SYSTEMS, BY INTEGRATING EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN THE LAB AND FIELD WITH COMPUTATIONAL MODELS, AND STUDY HOW VARIATION IN SENSORY PERCEPTION IMPACTS ON SOCIAL AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR, ECOLOGICAL INTERACTIONS, AND EVOLUTION.
WORK IN THIS AREA FOCUSES AROUND BIOLOGICAL FLUID DYNAMICS AT A NUMBER OF SCALES, FROM THE WHOLE ORGANISM DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF CELLULAR MOTILITY. WE HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY SUCCESSFUL AT INTRODUCING PHYSICAL THINKING INTO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVOLUTION AND FUNCTION OF SPERM LENGTH AND HAVE PROVIDED KEY INSIGHTS INTO THE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL VISCOSITY. WE USE THEORY, EXPERIMENT AND FIELD STUDIES TO ADDRESS A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FROM HOW SPERM SWIM, WHY BACTERIA HAVE DIFFERENT SHAPES, AND HOW BACTERIA RESPOND TO VISCOSITY IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT.
ANIMALS ARE UNDER CONSTANT PRESSURES FROM DISEASE, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND HUMAN ACTIVITY. WHEN ANIMALS ARE UNABLE TO OVERCOME THESE PRESSURES, THEIR WELFARE SUFFERS. FOR OWNERS, THIS IS UPSETTING AND FOR FARMERS, THIS MAY IMPACT PROFITS AND INCREASE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AT LINCOLN, WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF COMPANION, FARMED, AND WILD ANIMALS OF ALL TYPES.

RESEARCH IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF DESIGN
COLLEAGUES IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF DESIGN CARRY OUT RESEARCH IN A RICH VARIETY OF WAYS AND INTO A BROAD RANGE OF SUBJECTS. STAFF CARRY OUT BOTH PEDAGOGIC RESEARCH, WHICH INFORMS HOW WE TEACH AND ENABLES STUDENTS TO LEARN, AND MORE ACADEMIC RESEARCH CONCERNING A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS; FROM FLOOD PROTECTION TO COUNCIL ESTATE DESIGN, FROM PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE TO EXHIBITION DESIGN. RESEARCHERS WRITE BOOKS AND ACADEMIC ARTICLES, THEY CREATE PERFORMANCES, THEY MAKE DIFFERENT KINDS OF STUFF AND THEY WORK WITH NON-ACADEMIC PARTNERS OF VARIOUS KINDS.
IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH, COLLEAGUES IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF DESIGN ENGAGE IN A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES INCLUDING VARIOUS TYPES OF TEACHING, DIVERSE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, WIDE-RANGING OUTREACH, AND BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROJECTS. OUR PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE ACTIVITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE DIVERSE AND INCLUDE BOOK ART, SURF CULTURE, PRINTMAKING AND VISUAL ANTHROPOLOGY. OUR OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS PROJECTS ARE ALSO CHARACTERISED BY DIVERSITY, DEPTH AND BREADTH.

A FOCUS ON HUMAN-CENTRED, PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE, AND SOCIAL INNOVATION METHODS THAT SUPPORT SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING. THE RESEARCH MEMBERS AIM FOR THEIR RESEARCH OUTCOMES TO BE RESPONSIVE, SENSITIVE, INFORMED, RELEVANT, RIGOROUS, AND IMPACTFUL.
SOCIAL DESIGN IS A BROAD TERM WHICH CAN INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
CO-CREATION' AND PARTICIPATION BETWEEN DESIGNERS AND NON-DESIGNERS. INDEED, SOCIAL DESIGN RESTS ON AN EXPANDED DEFINITION OF BOTH DESIGN AND 'DESIGNERS' AND IT IS ONE WHICH CONSIDERS OBJECTS OF DESIGN THAT OTHER FORMS OF DESIGN RESEARCH HAVE REGARDED AS BEING OUTSIDE OF THE DIRECT CONCERNS OF DESIGN; BEHAVIOUR, SOCIAL POLICIES, SOCIAL PROCESSES. THIS EXPANDED SCOPE HAS ALLOWED SOCIAL DESIGN, AND SOCIAL DESIGN RESEARCH, TO ADDRESS 'BIG' SOCIETAL QUESTIONS; AGEING, HEALTH, WASTE, POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE, GOVERNANCE, AND SO ON. FURTHERMORE, DESIGN IS SEEN AS BEING ABLE TO LIAISE BETWEEN, BROKER, BRING TOGETHER OTHER SPECIALISTS IN POLICY AND PLANNING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY. SOCIAL INNOVATION AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP ARE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED AS KEY FEATURES OF SOCIAL DESIGN.", 'IN TERMS OF SOCIAL DESIGN RESEARCH IN THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF DESIGN, WE CAN THINK ABOUT RESEARCH OUTPUTS AND PROJECTS WHICH INVOLVE NON-ACADEMIC PARTNERS, CLIENTS AND GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY AND AT LOCAL AND REGIONAL LEVELS ESPECIALLY.
THE CROSS-DISCIPLINARY NATURE OF THE RESEARCH MEANS THAT ITS MEMBERS COME FROM DIFFERENT RESEARCH AREAS AND BACKGROUNDS. OUR CURRENT MEMBERS INCLUDE:
DESPITE THE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS PURSUED, WE AT THE LINCOLN SCHOOL OF DESIGN ARGUE THERE IS A COMMON THEME THAT TIES RESEARCH, PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, OUTREACH AND BUSINESS TOGETHER AND THAT IS 'SOCIALLY ENGAGED CREATIVE PRACTICE'. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
IT MEANS TWO THINGS. THE SCHOOL OF DESIGN IS COMMITTED TO BOTH INVOLVING OTHERS IN OUR FULL RANGE OF ACTIVITIES AND TO IMPROVE THE LIVES AND LIFE CHANCES OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE ENGAGE. THIS MIGHT BE 'SOCIAL DESIGN' RESEARCH WHICH ACTIVELY ENCOURAGES PARTICIPATION AND CO-CREATION IN THE DESIGN PROCESS; WE SEEK TO INCLUDE THOSE WHO WILL BE AFFECTED BY DESIGN IN THE DESIGN OF THOSE THINGS THAT WILL AFFECT THEM. FOR EXAMPLE, PROFESSOR ANNE CHICKS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON DESIGNING A MORE INCLUSIVE EXPERIENCE FOR BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED EXHIBITION VISITORS. SOCIALLY ENGAGED CREATIVE PRACTICE ALSO INVOLVES OUTREACH ACTIVITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, WORKING DIRECTLY WITH 'DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY' SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS IN ORDER TO BUILD STRONGER PATHS FOR STUDENTS TO GET TO UNIVERSITY TO STUDY DESIGN SUBJECTS. IT INCLUDES INVITING SCHOOL CHILDREN INTO THE UNIVERSITY TO EXPLORE AND EXPERIENCE CREATIVITY THROUGH, FOR EXAMPLE, THE SATURDAY CLUB AND THE BIG DRAW EVENTS. AND, OF COURSE THE UNIVERSITY EMPHASIS ON 'STUDENT AS PRODUCER' HAS ALWAYS FITTED COMFORTABLY WITH WHAT HAPPENS IN A DESIGN SCHOOL STUDIO CULTURE. STUDENTS ARE ALWAYS THE CO-PRODUCERS OF THE EXPERIENCE WE CREATE AND OF THE DESIGNED 'THINGS' WHICH COME FROM CREATIVE PRACTICE. CREATIVITY IS SOCIAL AND OUR ACTIVITIES REFLECT THAT.
CONSEQUENTLY, AS ACADEMICS AND CREATIVE PRACTITIONERS OURSELVES, WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR CONNECTIONS BETWEEN OUR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES, ESPECIALLY OUR CAPACITY TO BUILD RESEARCH. WE SEEK TO BUILD THIS RESEARCH OUT OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE FROM RESEARCH, OUTREACH FROM RESEARCH AND PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, ENTERPRISE FROM RESEARCH AND SO ON. AS A RESULT, MUCH OF OUR SCHOOL'S ACTIVITY IS DRIVEN BY PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE SOME COMBINATION OF RESEARCH, PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, OUTREACH AND ENTERPRISE. THIS THEN LEADS TO CLUSTERS OF ACTIVITY AROUND A THEME, FOR EXAMPLE, CREATIVITY, CREATIVE INDUSTRIES AND PEDAGOGIC RESEARCH ON CREATIVITY. WHERE THE RESEARCH AROUND A THEME DEVELOPS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY AND BUILDS A COMPELLING MOMENTUM, IT IS USEFUL TO FORM A RESEARCH CLUSTER TO CO-ORDINATE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING BIDDING FOR RESEARCH FUNDING, BUILDING RESEARCH IMPACT BEYOND THE UNIVERSITY, AND PROVIDING A FOCUS FOR THE ESTEEM THAT RESEARCH CAN GENERATE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A 'CRITICAL HERITAGE AND PLACE CONSUMPTION RESEARCH CLUSTER THAT DOES JUST THAT. OTHER THEMES OF INTEREST AND ACTIVITY MAY BE BETTER SERVED BY A LOOSER GROUPING OF CONTRIBUTING COLLEAGUES, AS THE TOPIC IN QUESTION LEADS TO DEVELOPMENTS IN PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE, OUTREACH, ENTERPRISE AS WELL AS RESEARCH. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COLLEAGUES RESEARCHING SOCIAL DESIGN, CO-CREATION AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.
THIS RESEARCH PROJECT INVESTIGATES HOW TO INCLUSIVELY DESIGN AND CURATE A NON-PERMANENT DESIGN EXHIBITION IN A LARGE REGIONAL GALLERY (THE NATIONAL CENTRE FOR CRAFT AND DESIGN, UK), FOCUSING ON INTELLECTUAL ACCESS FOR BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED VISITORS. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UK WHO ARE REGISTERED WITH SIGHT LOSS. OLDER PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SIGHT LOSS AND THEY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING VISITOR GROUP (65-74 YEARS) TO UK MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES.
PROFESSOR ANNE CHICK COLLABORATED WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND TAILORED THE CO-CREATION RESEARCH TO THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE BLIND AND PARTIALLY SIGHTED PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTING MULTI-SENSORY NON-PERMANENT EXHIBITION (27 JANUARY  23 APRIL 2017) IS AVAILABLE TO VIEW ON THERESEARCH PROJECT WEBSITE.
THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE ANONYMOUS PARTICIPANTS AND NCCD GALLERY ASSISTANTS, MIDLANDS REGIONAL RNIB CENTRE, BRYONY WINDSOR, ZOE PARTINGTON, COLIN WEBB, ARNAUD DECHELLE, AND KEVIN HALLSWORTH.
THIS RESEARCH WAS FUNDED BY THE ARTS COUNCIL ENGLAND UNDER GRANTS FOR THE ARTS, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR CRAFT & DESIGN, AND THE BIG LOTTERY UNDER THE DRILL FUND.

THE PROJECT HAD A NUMBER OF OUTPUTS, INCLUDING:
THE PROJECT AIMED TORECONCEPTUALISE MIDDLEFIELD LANE AS A MUTABLE PLACE NOT ALWAYS IN DECLINE (AND THUS NOT INEVITABLY SO IN THE FUTURE); DEVELOP SKILLS, CONNECTIONS, OUTLOOKS AND ASPIRATIONS TO HELP THE COMMUNITY CONTEXTUALISE ITS PRESENT AND BUILD FOR A BETTER FUTURE; AND CHAMPION COUNCIL HOUSING IN A PERIOD LACKING GOOD, AFFORDABLE, RENTED HOUSING.?
THIS RESEARCH HAS A DUAL FOCUS. FIRSTLY, IT INVOLVES RESEARCH INTO BROAD THEORIES OF CREATIVITY - THE DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF CREATIVITY WHICH INCLUDE THE PERSONAL-CENTRED APPROACHES OF NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY, RELATIONSHIPS-CENTRED APPROACHES OF SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY, AND WIDER CONTEXT-CENTRED APPROACHES OF ECONOMICS, URBAN STUDIES AND WEB STUDIES. HOWEVER, THIS LARGELY THEORETICAL RESEARCH IS STRONGLY CONNECTED TO MORE APPLIED ASPECTS FOCUSSED UPON TEACHING CREATIVITY AND HELPING TO DEVELOP PROFESSIONAL CREATIVE PRACTICES. THE SECOND FOCUS CONCERNS BROAD SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSES OF THE CREATIVE AND CULTURAL INDUSTRIES  HOW VARIOUS CREATIVE ECOLOGIES EMERGE, HOW INFORMAL CREATIVE HUBS AND NETWORKS OPERATE, HOW CULTURAL POLICY MIGHT BEST APPROACH AND WORK WITH THESE MORE INFORMAL CREATIVE SPACES.
SOME OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WHICH ANIMATE THIS RESEARCH ARE:
A WELLSPRING OF OUR SHARED RESEARCH AGENDA IS THE BELIEF THAT ORTHODOX ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CREATIVITY FLOWING FROM ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS IS LACKING. OUR RESEARCH INTO THEORIES OF CREATIVITY TEND TO MOVE THROUGH MORE SOCIAL AND CULTURAL CONCEPTIONS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CREATIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE, AND BETWEEN PEOPLE, THEIR PLACES AND OTHER BROADER CONTEXTUAL FEATURES. OUR RESEARCH INTO THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES TENDS TO FOCUS UPON THE INTER-RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDEPENDENT, COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC ASPECTS OF BROAD CREATIVE ECOLOGIES.
THE CENTRALITY OF THIS MORE SOCIAL AND RELATIONAL CONCEPTION ALSO INFORMS WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF CONCRETE APPLICATIONS OF OUR RESEARCH FOR PEDAGOGY AND DEVELOPING PROFESSIONAL CREATIVE PRACTICE FOR ENTERPRISE AND ENTREPRENEURIAL DISCUSSIONS.
RESEARCHERS OFTEN SEEK NOVEL WAYS OF DELIVERING RESEARCH TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONTEXTS, IN WAYS SUITABLE TO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES. AS WELL PUBLISHING RESEARCH OUTPUTS IN THE ORTHODOX MANNER, OUR MEMBERS FACILITATE CREATIVE PLAY SESSIONS; SEEK TO ADVOCATE FOR DRAWING AND IMAGE-MAKING INTO RESEARCH OUTPUTS; TRANSLATE ACADEMIC RESEARCH INTO ENGAGING AND PRACTICAL OUTCOMES FOR USE IN CREATIVE PRACTICES;
THESE APPROACHES INVOLVE WORKING WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PARTNERS INCLUDING CREATIVE BUSINESSES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, RUNNING PUBLICALLY FUNDED PROGRAMMES FOR DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AND WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES.
THE CREATIVITY AND CULTURAL INDUSTRIES RESEARCH IS CROSS-DISCIPLINARY AND DRAWS RESEARCHERS FROM BROAD RESEARCH TOPICS AND SUBJECTS. OUR CURRENTRESEARCHERS INCLUDE:
CHPC RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE NOTION OF CRITICAL HERITAGE, WHICH CONSIDERS PLACES, PASTS AND TRADITIONS IN CONTEMPORARY LIFE ALONGSIDE HERITAGES TRADITIONAL CONCERNS WITH CONSERVATION AND RESTORATION.CRITICAL HERITAGE, AS A DISCIPLINE, RECONCEPTUALISES HERITAGE BY PAYING ATTENTION TO THEMES SUCH AS POWER, IDENTITY, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CONFLICT, AND BY ENGAGING WITH OTHER AREAS OF CRITICAL ENQUIRY SUCH AS MEMORY STUDIES, CREATIVE TOURISM, FEMINIST THEORY, MATERIAL CULTURE STUDIES, AND CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY.
IN PARTICULAR, RESEARCH FOCUSES ON DESIGN PRACTICES WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF HERITAGE, AND AIMS TO FOSTER COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS AND DISCUSSIONS ON THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TRADITION AND CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY, AND HOW THIS IS VISUALLY EXPRESSED. THIS INCLUDES INVESTIGATING NEW EMERGING PATTERNS OF SPACE/PLACE, EXHIBITION DESIGN, AND PLACE CONSUMPTION (AMONGST OTHERS).
THE SECOND IS CONCERNED WITH BROAD SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANALYSES OF THE CREATIVE AND CULTURAL INDUSTRIES, HOW VARIOUS CREATIVE ECOLOGIES EMERGE, HOW INFORMAL CREATIVE HUBS AND NETWORKS OPERATE, AND HOW CULTURAL POLICY MIGHT BEST APPROACH AND WORK WITH THESE MORE INFORMAL CREATIVE SPACES.
THE JOSEPH BANKS LABORATORIES AND MINSTER HOUSE ARE A PURPOSE-BUILT SCIENCE FACILITY, DEVELOPED BY A COLLABORATIVE TEAM INCLUDING TEACHING AND RESEARCH STAFF, ESTATES AND ICT PROFESSIONALS, ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS.

PHARMACISTS ARE TO BE FOUND WITHIN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND REGULATORY BODIES, UNDERTAKING A VARIETY OF ROLES SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OR REGULATORY AND DRUG SAFETY ROLES. INCREASINGLY PHARMACISTS ARE TO BE FOUND WORKING IN PRIMARY CARE, OFTEN AS PRESCRIBING PHARMACISTS WITH GENERAL PRACTITIONERS. WITHIN HOSPITAL PHARMACY MANY PHARMACISTS WORK AS FULL TIME CLINICAL PHARMACISTS, PROVIDING DIRECT CARE TO PATIENTS AND MAY ACHIEVE A CONSULTANT RANK. WITHIN COMMUNITY PHARMACY PRACTICE, THE ROLE OF THE PHARMACIST IS CONTINUALLY EXPANDING TO INCLUDE MEDICATION REVIEWS, EARLY DIAGNOSIS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES, PARTICULARLY IN HEALTHY LIVING PHARMACIES.MANY PHARMACY GRADUATES UNDERTAKE POSTGRADUATE QUALIFICATIONS, SUCH AS DIPLOMAS, PROFESSIONAL DOCTORATES, AND PHDS BY RESEARCH.IN ADDITION THE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION SKILLS, PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION-MAKING SKILLS ARE VALUABLE IN MANY OTHER SPHERES OF EMPLOYMENT.A DEGREE IN PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE MIGHT LEAD TO A JOB IN ONE OF THE BIG PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, BUT THERE ARE ALSO MANY OPPORTUNITIES IN A MYRIAD OF SMALLER BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN THE UK, EUROPE AND EVEN FURTHER AFIELD. IN ADDITION TO A SCIENCE-BASED CAREER, A DEGREE IN PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE MAY OPEN THE DOOR TO SALES AND MARKETING, PROJECT MANAGEMENT OR PROGRAMME MANAGEMENT, QUALITY ASSURANCE, OR IN DRUG REGULATION AND SAFETY.YOU MAY WISH TO FURTHER YOUR STUDIES TO MSC, MPHIL, OR PHD LEVEL, AND IF YOU DECIDE TO DO SO, WE HOPE TO SEE YOU BACK AT LINCOLN.
MPHARM STUDENTS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERTAKE PLACEMENTS WITHIN HOSPITAL, COMMUNITY, PRIMARY CARE AND INDUSTRIAL PHARMACY; THESE WILL BE INTEGRATED TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT. AS PART OF THE PLACEMENT PROGRAM, STUDENTS WILL HAVE THEIR OWN PRACTICING PHARMACIST MENTOR FOR THE DURATION OF THEIR STUDIES. FOR STUDENTS ON THE BSC PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE PROGRAM THIS WILL INCLUDE VISITS TO THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS VISITING LECTURERS FROM THE INDUSTRY.
THE SCHOOL HAS DEVELOPED EXTENSIVE LINKS WITH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY PHARMACY AND WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IN THE REGION AND ON A NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LEVEL. AN EXTERNAL ADVISORY GROUP, WHICH INCLUDE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVES, HAVE AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND TEACHING FOR THE MPHARM.FOR PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE, THERE IS A CURRICULUM ADVISORY BOARD WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND ASSOCIATED INDUSTRIES, TO ENSURE ARE GRADUATES ARE INDUSTRY READY.
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS PROVISIONALLY APPROVED BY THE GENERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COUNCIL (GPHC) TO OFFER THE INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING COURSE FOR 3 YEARS, WITH A MONITORING EVENT TAKING PLACE AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FIRST COHORT OF STUDENTS.
PHARMACISTS PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN DELIVERING CARE AND HELPING PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH, SAFETY AND, WELLBEING. AN INCREASINGLY CENTRAL ROLE FOR PHARMACISTS IS PRESCRIBING IN SETTINGS WHERE PRESCRIBING HAS NOT NECESSARILY HAPPENED BEFORE. BY DOING THIS, PHARMACISTS CAN PLAY AN IMPORTANT PART IN HELPING PEOPLE TO TAKE THEIR MEDICINES SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. BEING AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER MEANS THAT YOU CAN PRESCRIBE A MEDICINE WITHOUT NEEDING TO CONSULT ANOTHER PRESCRIBER FIRST (GPHC, 2022A, 4).
FOLLOWING A PUBLIC CONSULTATION EXERCISE DURING 2021, THE GPHC HAS RECENTLY AMENDED ITS APPLICATION CRITERIA FOR INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING (IP) PROGRAMMES. THE CHIEF PHARMACEUTICAL OFFICERS IN ALL FOUR COUNTRIES OF THE UK HAVE SET OUT A CLEAR DESIRE AND POLICY TO:
THE TWO REVISED APPLICATION CRITERIA FOR FREE-STANDING COURSES, (C AND D IN BOLD TYPE), TOGETHER WITH SOME IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR APPLICANTS, APPEAR BELOW UNDER ENTRY REQUIREMENTS.
THE LEVEL OF STUDY FOR PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER COURSES IS MASTERS LEVEL, AS DEFINED IN NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORKS. THE TRAINEE PRESCRIBER MUST EVIDENCE THEIR ACHIEVEMENT OF ALL OF THE LEARNING OUTCOMES INCLUDED IN PART 1 OF THE STANDARDS FOR THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS (GPHC, 2022A, 6-9). ALL COURSES MUST INCLUDE A MINIMUM OF 26 STRUCTURED STUDY DAYS AND 90 HOURS OF SUPERVISED LEARNING IN PRACTICE (GPHC, 2022A, 6).
LEARNING IN PRACTICE TIME IS WHEN PHARMACISTS INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS IN TRAINING PRACTISE AND DEVELOP THEIR CLINICAL, DIAGNOSTIC AND PRESCRIBING SKILLS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. THIS INCLUDES THEIR DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER (WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNING OFF A PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER IN TRAINING AS BEING A COMPETENT PRESCRIBER) (GPHC, 2022A,11).
PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS IN TRAINING MUST PASS ALL SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENTS BEFORE BEING SIGNED OFF. THIS BEING THE CASE, AND ON SAFETY GROUNDS, COMPENSATION OR CONDONATION ARE NOT ALLOWED ON COURSES FOR PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS IN TRAINING (GPHC, 2022A, 17).
ONCE A PHARMACIST HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THEIR COURSE, THEY WILL RECEIVE THEIR PRACTICE CERTIFICATE IN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING AWARD FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AND CAN APPLY TO THE GPHC FOR AN ANNOTATION AS AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER TO THEIR ENTRY IN THE GPHCS REGISTER. THE ANNOTATION IS A PUBLIC RECORD THAT THEY CAN PRACTISE AS AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER (GPHC, 2022A, 5).
THE ENTRY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING COURSE ARE THAT:
A) APPLICANTS ARE REGISTERED AS A PHARMACIST WITH THE GENERAL PHARMACEUTICAL COUNCIL (GPHC) OR, IN NORTHERN IRELAND, WITH THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF NORTHERN IRELAND (PSNI) (GPHC, 2022A, 10).
B) APPLICANTS ARE IN GOOD STANDING WITH THE GPHC AND/OR PSNI AND ANY OTHER HEALTHCARE REGULATOR WITH WHICH THEY ARE REGISTERED (GPHC, 2022A, 10).
C) APPLICANTS MUST HAVE RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN A UK PHARMACY SETTING AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE, UNDERSTAND AND ARTICULATE THE SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED BY A PRESCRIBER. THIS EXPERIENCE AND AWARENESS WILL ACT AS THE BASIS OF THEIR PRESCRIBING PRACTICE WHILST TRAINING (GPHC, 2022A, 12).
THE EXAMPLES GIVEN ABOVE ARE INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE WIDE RANGING AND UNIQUE NATURE OF RELEVANT PHARMACY EXPERIENCE THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A PHARMACISTS OVERALL READINESS TO ENROL ON AN ACCREDITED INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING COURSE. THERE IS NOT A SPECIFIC LENGTH OF TIME THAT WILL DETERMINE THIS. IT IS THE OVERALL BREADTH AND RANGE OF RELEVANT EXPERIENCE THAT IS IMPORTANT (GPHC, 2022B, 3).
YOU WILL BE REQUESTED TO PROVIDE YOUR CV AS PART OF OUR APPLICATION PROCESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN SCHOOL OF PHARMACY AND TO PROVIDE A WRITTEN NARRATIVE (OF NO MORE THAN 800 WORDS) SUMMARISING HOW YOUR EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE ROLES OR PLACEMENTS DETAILED WITHIN YOUR CV HAVE PREPARED YOU TO UNDERTAKE YOUR TRAINING AS A PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER. YOUR NARRATIVE MUST INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:
AS STATED WITHIN ENTRY REQUIREMENT C) ABOVE, YOU MUST BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE, UNDERSTAND, AND ARTICULATE THE SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED BY A PRESCRIBER.
THE APPLICATION PROCESS AT THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY REQUIRES YOU TO PROVIDE A SHORT REFLECTION TO DEMONSTRATE HOW YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS STRENGTHENED YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF THE PRESCRIBER AND HAS SUPPORTED HOW YOU RECOGNISE, UNDERSTAND, AND ARTICULATE THE SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES OF A PRESCRIBER.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT MANY OF THE SKILLS REQUIRED BY A PRESCRIBER ARE THE SAME AS THOSE OF A NON-PRESCRIBER. YOUR STANDARDS FOR PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS (GPHC, 2017) SHOULD, THEREFORE, UNDERPIN AND INFORM YOUR APPLICATION. THERE ARE NINE STANDARDS THAT EVERY PHARMACY PROFESSIONAL IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MEETING. THEY DESCRIBE HOW SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE IS DELIVERED THROUGH PERSON-CENTRED PROFESSIONALISM.
THE STANDARDS ARE A STATEMENT OF WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT FROM PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS AND REFLECT WHAT PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS HAVE TOLD THE GPHC THAT THEY EXPECT OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR COLLEAGUES. THE MEANING OF EACH OF THE STANDARDS IS EXPLAINED, AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS THAT PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS SHOULD DEMONSTRATE, AND THEREFORE, ARE CONSISTENT ALSO FOR PRESCRIBING.
THE STANDARDS FOR THE INITIAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING OF PHARMACISTS (GPHC, 2021B) HAVE DETERMINED KEY LEARNING OUTCOMES THAT A TRAINEE PHARMACIST WOULD BE EXPECTED TO DEMONSTRATE UPON REGISTRATION IN RELATION TO BEING A PRESCRIBER, AND THE GPHC EXPECTS APPLICANTS TO UNDERSTAND THESE AND THEIR IMPORTANCE WHEN PRESCRIBING MEDICINES. THESE ALSO ALIGN TO THE PRESCRIBING COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK (RPS, 2021) (SEE BELOW).
THE COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK FOR ALL PRESCRIBERS (RPS, 2021) DESCRIBES THE DEMONSTRABLE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, CHARACTERISTICS, QUALITIES AND BEHAVIOURS FOR A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PRESCRIBING ROLE AND SETS OUT WHAT GOOD PRESCRIBING LOOKS LIKE. IT IS A GENERIC FRAMEWORK THAT CAN BE USED BY ANY PRESCRIBER AT ANY POINT IN THEIR CAREER, REGARDLESS OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND. IT SHOULD, HOWEVER, BE CONTEXTUALISED TO REFLECT DIFFERENT AREAS OF PRACTICE, LEVELS OF EXPERTISE, AND SETTINGS.
THERE ARE TEN COMPETENCIES WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK WHICH ARE PRESENTED IN TWO DOMAINS AND DESCRIBE THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILL, BEHAVIOUR, ACTIVITY OR OUTCOME THAT PRESCRIBERS SHOULD DEMONSTRATE.
DOMAIN ONE - THE CONSULTATION:
THIS DOMAIN LOOKS AT THE COMPETENCIES THAT THE PRESCRIBER SHOULD DEMONSTRATE DURING THE CONSULTATION. DOMAIN ONE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING COMPETENCIES:
1. ASSESS THE PATIENT
THIS DOMAIN FOCUSES ON THE COMPETENCIES THAT THE PRESCRIBER SHOULD DEMONSTRATE WITH RESPECT TO PRESCRIBING GOVERNANCE. DOMAIN TWO CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING COMPETENCIES:
EACH OF THESE COMPETENCIES CONTAINS SEVERAL SUPPORTING STATEMENTS RELATED TO THE PRESCRIBER ROLE, WHICH DESCRIBE THE ACTIVITY OR OUTCOME THAT THE PRESCRIBER SHOULD ACTIVELY AND ROUTINELY DEMONSTRATE.
THE GPHC WOULD EXPECT APPLICANTS TO HAVE A BROAD UNDERSTANDING OF THIS FRAMEWORK AND USE THIS AS THE BASIS FOR RECOGNISING, UNDERSTANDING, AND ARTICULATING THE SKILLS OF A PRESCRIBER SPECIFICALLY. THIS, ALONGSIDE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STANDARDS FOR PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS AND CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO SCOPE OF PRACTICE, IS FUNDAMENTAL TO CONFIRM THAT AN APPLICANT HAS THE APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE TO COMMENCE AS A PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER IN TRAINING.
BASED ON THE ABOVE, THE GPHC SUGGESTS SOME NOTABLE EXAMPLES OF THE SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES REQUIRED BY A PRESCRIBER THAT MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
APPLICANTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAS STRENGTHENED THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROLE OF PRESCRIBER AND HAS SUPPORTED HOW THEY RECOGNISE, UNDERSTAND, AND ARTICULATE THE SKILLS OF A PRESCRIBER.
THIS WILL BE UNIQUE TO EACH APPLICANT, HOWEVER, THIS IN COMBINATION WITH THEIR RELEVANT EXPERIENCE IN A UK PHARMACY SETTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, TO GAIN ASSURANCE THAT THEY ARE SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO COMMENCE ON AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING COURSE (GPHC, 2022B, 5).
FOR THE PURPOSES OF DEVELOPING THEIR INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING PRACTICE APPLICANTS MUST IDENTIFY AN AREA OF CLINICAL OR THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR LEARNING (GPHC, 2022A, 10).
THE APPLICATION PROCESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN THEREFORE REQUIRES YOU TO DESCRIBE THE CLINICAL OR THERAPEUTIC AREA IN WHICH YOU INTEND TO BASE YOUR LEARNING AND TO GIVE THE RATIONALE FOR YOUR CHOICE.
AN UNDERSTANDING OF SCOPE OF PRACTICE, THE ACTIVITIES A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL CARRIES OUT WITHIN THEIR PROFESSIONAL ROLE, IS FUNDAMENTAL. THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST HAVE THE REQUIRED TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND EXPERIENCE TO DELIVER PRESCRIBING ACTIVITIES LAWFULLY, SAFELY, AND EFFECTIVELY.
SCOPE OF PRACTICE SHOULD BE INFORMED BY THE INDIVIDUALS PROFESSIONAL JUDGEMENT AS WELL AS, FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORY STANDARDS, THE PROFESSIONAL LEADERSHIP BODYS POSITION, EMPLOYER GUIDANCE, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DOCUMENTS AND GUIDANCE FROM OTHER RELEVANT ORGANISATIONS, SUCH AS NHS GUIDELINES OR JOURNALS. THE IDENTIFIED AREA OF CLINICAL OR THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE CAN BE EITHER SPECIALIST OR GENERALIST (GPHC, 2022B, 5).
ONCE A PHARMACIST HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE TRAINING, THEY CAN APPLY FOR AN ANNOTATION TO THEIR ENTRY ON THE GPHCS REGISTER. THE ANNOTATION IS A PUBLIC RECORD THAT THEY CAN PRACTISE AS AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER. PHARMACISTS SHOULD, HOWEVER, ONLY PRESCRIBE WITHIN THEIR AREA OF COMPETENCE UPON ANNOTATION.
IT IS ACCEPTED THAT, PROVIDED THE PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER EXPANDS THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE SUBSEQUENTLY, THEY CAN PRESCRIBE ACCORDINGLY.
D) APPLICANTS HAVE A DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER WHO HAS AGREED TO SUPERVISE THEIR LEARNING IN PRACTICE (GPHC, 2022A, 10). THE APPLICANTS DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER MUST BE A REGISTERED HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL IN GREAT BRITAIN OR NORTHERN IRELAND WITH LEGAL INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING RIGHTS, WHO IS SUITABLY EXPERIENCED AND QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THIS SUPERVISORY ROLE, AND WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED CPD OR REVALIDATION RELEVANT TO THIS ROLE. 
ALTHOUGH AN APPLICANT MAY BE SUPERVISED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON, ONLY ONE PRESCRIBER MUST BE THE DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER. THE DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER IS THE PERSON WHO WILL CERTIFY THAT SUCCESSFUL PHARMACISTS ARE COMPETENT TO PRACTISE AS INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS (GPHC, 2022A, 11).
APPLICANTS MUST PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THEY MEET THE GPHCS CRITERIA FOR ELIGIBILITY TO ACCESS THIS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, AS THE COURSE PROVIDER, TO EVALUATE ALL APPLICATIONS AND TO ASSESS THE SUITABILITY OF PHARMACISTS ALREADY ON THE REGISTER TO ENTER TRAINING (GPHC, 2021, 15). YOU WILL THEREFORE BE REQUIRED TO EVIDENCE THE QUALITY OF YOUR PATIENT-FACING EXPERIENCE AS PART OF YOUR APPLICATION FOR THIS SHORT COURSE.
IN ADDITION, THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY WILL ACT IN FULL COLLABORATION WITH OUR PRACTICE PARTNERS BY ENSURING THAT THE RELEVANT PARTIES CONTRIBUTING TOWARDS YOUR APPLICATION FOR TRAINING AS A PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER ARE APPROPRIATELY CONSULTED, IN RELATION TO YOUR SUITABILITY FOR THIS TRAINING.
YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE WRITTEN CONFIRMATION (VIA COMPLETION OF THE RELEVANT APPLICATION FORMS) FROM:
A) YOUR EMPLOYER/LINE MANAGER (WHERE APPLICABLE) OF THEIR SUPPORT FOR YOU TO UNDERTAKE THE INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING FOR PHARMACISTS SHORT COURSE. YOUR EMPLOYER WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED AN AREA OF CLINICAL OR THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE ON WHICH TO BASE YOUR LEARNING.
B) A DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER (DPP) WHO MEETS THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SUPERVISION OF TRAINEE INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS, AND WHO HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE SUPERVISION OF YOUR LEARNING IN PRACTICE FOR A MINIMUM OF 90 HOURS (GPHC, 2022A, 6). YOUR NOMINATED DPP WILL BE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED AN AREA OF CLINICAL OR THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE ON WHICH TO BASE YOUR LEARNING.
PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PLACES OFFERED ON THIS SHORT COURSE WILL BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE GPHC AND UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN ENTRY REQUIREMENTS DETAILED ABOVE BEING FULLY MET. FURTHER, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMMENCE YOUR SHORT COURSE IF ANY OF THESE REQUIREMENTS REMAIN OUTSTANDING.
TRAINEE PRESCRIBERS HAVE HISTORICALLY UNDERTAKEN A PERIOD OF LEARNING IN PRACTICE TO CONSOLIDATE AND CONTEXTUALISE THEIR ACADEMIC LEARNING. UNTIL RECENT REGULATORY CHANGES, MEDICALLY QUALIFIED DOCTORS HAVE CARRIED OUT THE VITAL ROLE OF SUPERVISING, EDUCATING, AND ASSESSING TRAINEE PRESCRIBERS IN PRACTICE. THE TITLE FOR THIS ROLE WAS FORMERLY DESIGNATED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER (DMP).
HOWEVER, SINCE 2018/19, SOME EXPERIENCED NON-MEDICAL PRESCRIBERS (NMPS) HAVE NOW BECOME ELIGIBLE TO FULFIL THIS ESSENTIAL ROLE. THE ROYAL PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY (RPS) PUBLISHED GUIDANCE FOLLOWING THESE CHANGES TO REFLECT THE EXPANSION OF THIS ROLE TO INCLUDE NMPS, ADOPTING THE TERM DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER (DPP) FOR ALL ROLES THAT "OVERSEE, SUPPORT AND ASSESS THE COMPETENCE OF NON-MEDICAL PRESCRIBING TRAINEES IN COLLABORATION WITH ACADEMIC AND WORKPLACE PARTNERS DURING THE PERIOD OF LEARNING IN PRACTICE." (RPS, 2019, 3). MEDICALLY QUALIFIED DOCTORS CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED WITHIN THE NEW TITLE OF DPP.
THE ROLE OF DPP IS A SIGNIFICANT AND IMPORTANT ONE AS, AT THE END OF THEIR SHORT COURSE AND PROVIDING ALL ASPECTS OF THE ASSESSMENT STRATEGY ARE COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY, THE DPP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SIGNING OFF A TRAINEE AS BEING FIT TO PRACTICE AS AN INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER (GPHC, 2022A, 11).
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE DPP ROLE
A PROSPECTIVE DPP MUST BE REGISTERED, AND IN GOOD STANDING WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL REGULATOR(S). ALL NON- MEDICAL PRESCRIBERS (NMPS) UNDERTAKING THE ROLE SHOULD HAVE THE NECESSARY ANNOTATION FOR A PRESCRIBER AS REQUIRED BY THEIR REGULATOR (RPS, 2019, 4; GPHC, 2022A, 10).
THIS MEANS THAT THE DPP MUST BE A QUALIFIED INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBER (V300) OR MEDICAL PRESCRIBER WITH LEGAL INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING RIGHTS, NOT A SUPPLEMENTARY PRESCRIBER OR SPECIALIST COMMUNITY NURSE PRESCRIBER. THE DPP MUST BE SUITABLY EXPERIENCED TO CARRY OUT THIS SUPERVISORY ROLE AND HAVE DEMONSTRATED CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT (CPD) OR REVALIDATION RELEVANT TO THE INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING ROLE (GPHC, 2022A, 10).
COURSE PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE APPROPRIATE MECHANISMS FOR ENSURING THAT DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONERS ARE FIT TO BE THE SUPERVISORS OF PHARMACIST INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS IN TRAINING (GPHC, 2022A, 17). THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY IS THEREFORE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE THE SUITABILITY OF EACH NOMINATED DPP, AND FOR THIS REASON, WE ASK THAT YOU PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBING EXPERIENCE DURING THE APPLICATION PROCESS.
IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT NON-MEDICAL PRESCRIBERS (NMPS) AND INDEPENDENT PRESCRIBERS (IPS) COMPLETE THE TRAINING FOR THE ROLE OF PRACTICE ASSESSOR, OR EQUIVALENT TRAINING, WHERE THIS IS PROVIDED BY YOUR ORGANISATION.
IF YOU ARE A NOMINATED DPP, AND HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, OR WOULD APPRECIATE SOME ASSISTANCE WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE APPLICATION FORM, PLEASE EMAIL OUR ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM IN THE FIRST INSTANCE, WHO WILL ENSURE THAT AN APPROPRIATE MEMBER OF THE TEAM RESPONDS TO YOUR ENQUIRY: PHARMACY@LINCOLN.AC.UK.
THE EXPECTATION OF ANY HEALTH PROFESSIONAL PRACTITIONER ACTING IN THE DPP ROLE IS THE ABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE THEY MEET ALL COMPETENCIES WITHIN THE COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK FOR ALL PRESCRIBERS (RPS, 2021, 4).
PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS THE PRACTITIONER TAKING ON THE DPP ROLE: 1.1 RECOGNISES THE VALUE AND RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DPP ROLE1.2 DEMONSTRATES CLINICAL LEADERSHIP THROUGH THEIR PRACTICE 1.3 DEMONSTRATES A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT TRAINEES 1.4 DISPLAYS PROFESSIONAL INTEGRITY: IS OBJECTIVE IN SUPERVISION AND/OR ASSESSMENT 1.5 IS OPEN, APPROACHABLE AND EMPATHETIC 1.6 CREATES A POSITIVE LEARNING CULTURE THROUGH THEIR PRACTICE
THE PRACTITIONER TAKING ON THE DPP ROLE: 2.1 WORKS IN LINE WITH LEGAL, REGULATORY, PROFESSIONAL AND ORGANISATIONAL STANDARDS2.2 IS AN EXPERIENCED PRESCRIBER IN A PATIENT-FACING ROLE (AN EXPERIENCED PRESCRIBER IS DEFINED AS AN ACTIVE PRESCRIBER WHO WOULD NORMALLY HAVE AT LEAST 3 YEARS RECENT PRESCRIBING EXPERIENCE)2.3 IS AN ACTIVE PRESCRIBER IN A PATIENT-FACING ROLE WITH APPROPRIATE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE RELEVANT TO THE TRAINEES AREA OF CLINICAL PRACTICE (AN ACTIVE PRESCRIBER CONSULTS WITH PATIENTS AND MAKES PRESCRIBING DECISIONS BASED ON CLINICAL ASSESSMENT WITH SUFFICIENT FREQUENCY TO MAINTAIN COMPETENCE. REFLECTS AND AUDITS PRESCRIBING PRACTICE TO IDENTIFY DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS)2.4 HAS UP-TO-DATE PATIENT-FACING CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC SKILLS AND EVIDENCE OF DEMONSTRATING COMPETENCE IN AN AREA OF PRACTICE RELEVANT TO THE TRAINEE
THE PRACTITIONER TAKING ON THE DPP ROLE:
3.3 ARTICULATES DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND JUSTIFIES THE RATIONALE FOR DECISIONS WHEN TEACHING OR TRAINING OTHERS
PREPARATION FOR THE ROLE OF DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONER (DPP) 
THE GPHC REQUIRES COURSE PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE TRAINING FOR DESIGNATED PRESCRIBING PRACTITIONERS (DPPS). THIS MUST COMPRISE:
THE ACADEMIC PROGRAMME TEAM WILL PROVIDE ALL DPPS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THIS IP SPECIFIC TRAINING IN PERSON OR ALTERNATIVELY, WILL PROVIDE A LINK TO AN ONLINE TEACHING PACKAGE THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS REMOTELY. THE TRAINING WILL TAKE AROUND 45 MINUTES WHETHER ACCESSED ONLINE OR IN PERSON.
THE ACADEMIC TEACHING TEAM WILL ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS, WHETHER YOU CHOOSE TO ATTEND THE TRAINING IN PERSON OR COMPLETE THE VIDEO TEACHING PACKAGE WHICH WILL BE ACCESSED VIA THE UNIVERSITY PANOPTO PLATFORM (NO PASSWORDS ARE NEEDED).
THE PROGRAMME TEAM PLEDGE TO SUPPORT DPPS IN THEIR ROLE, AND TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR PERFORMANCE AS PRESCRIBING SUPERVISORS AND ASSESSORS. THE TEAM IS COMMITTED TO THE PROVISION OF ONGOING SUPPORT AND ADVICE FOR DPPS AND WILL ARRANGE EXTRA TRAINING, SUPPORT, AND DEVELOPMENT AS NECESSARY (GPHC, 2022A, 19).
THE ACADEMIC TEACHING TEAM APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK, AND WE WILL ASK YOU TO KINDLY PROVIDE SOME QUALITATIVE COMMENTS ON ASPECTS OF OUR SHORT COURSE, SUCH AS YOUR SUGGESTIONS FOR SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS WE MIGHT MAKE, AND HOW WELL YOU FEEL YOU HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED AS A DPP, AT THE END OF YOUR TRAINEE PRESCRIBERS PERIOD OF SUPERVISION.

ONE OF THE WORLDS GREAT HISTORIC CITIES, LINCOLN IS RENOWNED FOR ITS FUSION OF OLD AND NEW. THIS RICH VARIETY OF ATTRACTIONS, ACTIVITIES, AND AMENITIES, MAKES IT A FANTASTIC PLACE TO LIVE.
OUR EXPERT ACADEMICS AND RESEARCHERS ARE ENGAGED IN GROUNDBREAKING STUDIES THAT ARE TRANSFORMING LIVES AND COMMUNITIES AND ADDRESSING SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS FACING US IN THE WORLD TODAY.
THE TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODS USED ON THE MEDICINE PROGRAMMES TAKE MANY DIFFERENT FORMS. EXAMPLES OF THESE INCLUDE ANATOMY SESSIONS, CASE-BASED LEARNING, CLINICAL RELEVANCE SESSIONS, CLINICAL SKILLS SESSIONS, ELEARNING, LAB SESSIONS, LECTURES, PLACEMENTS, PRACTICAL CLASSES, SELF-STUDY, SEMINARS, AND TUTORIALS. EXAMPLES OF SOME OF THESE AREAS CAN BE FOUND BELOW.
IN PRACTICAL CLASSES LEARNING IS HANDS ON, AND DESIGNED TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO APPLY AND TEST THE THEORY THEY HAVE BEEN LEARNING.
THE DRUGS IN THE EYE PRACTICAL SESSION FOR EXAMPLE INVOLVES THE USE OF TOPICALLY ADMINISTERED DRUGS TO THE EYE TO INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECT ON SMOOTH MUSCLE, ENABLING STUDENTS TO GAIN A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM.
THE MEDICINE PROGRAMME AT LINCOLN INCORPORATES INTER-PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES AT DIFFERENT STAGES TO ALLOW MEDICAL STUDENTS TO PREPARE FOR PROVIDING OPTIMAL PATIENT CARE IN A COLLABORATIVE TEAM ENVIRONMENT.
THESE EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES ALLOW MEDICAL STUDENTS TO INTERACT WITH, LEARN FROM, AND ABOUT THE ROLE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, AND EXPLORE CASE STUDIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY CORRELATE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE BEST OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS.
STUDENTS AT LINCOLN ARE TAUGHT ANATOMY THROUGH PRO SECTION IN OUR NEW ANATOMY SUITE. IN ADDITION, THE MEDICAL SCHOOL ALSO HAS A SUITE OF MODELS OF HUMAN BODY PARTS AS WELL AS BONES WHICH WILL BE USED THROUGHOUT THE COURSE.
THERE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT EMPHASIS PLACED ON SURFACE ANATOMY EDUCATION. SURFACE ANATOMY IS THE ABILITY TO RELATE HUMAN INTERNAL BODY PARTS TO THE SURFACE OF THE BODY AND IS A VITAL PART OF ANATOMY EDUCATION.
THERE ARE ALSO A HOST OF ONLINE LEARNING MATERIALS SUCH AS RADIOLOGICAL IMAGING AND VIDEOS THAT WILL ALSO BE USED TO ENHANCE THE LEARNING OF ANATOMY.
EARLY INSIGHT AND EXPLORATION OF CLINICAL ISSUES AS WELL AS PRACTICE OF CLINICAL SKILLS ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF THE EARLY YEARS OF THE MEDICINE PROGRAMMES.
OUR STUDENTS CAN EXPLORE COMMUNICATION AND ETHICAL ISSUES IN MEDICINE AND CAN BEGIN LEARNING THE SKILLS OF CLINICAL PRACTICE SUCH AS HISTORY TAKING, EXAMINATION, AND ASSESSMENT.
DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF THE MEDICINE PROGRAMME, MEDICAL THEMES ARE EXPLORED USING CASE STUDIES AGAINST WHICH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT LEARNING METHODS ARE ALIGNED.
 LEARNING, WE INVITE MEMBERS OF OUR CLINICAL COMMUNITY TO DELIVER TEACHING SESSIONS ON SPECIALIST CLINICAL SUBJECTS AND CO-HOST PLENARY SESSIONS AT THE END OF EACH TEACHING WEEK TO HELP ASSIMILATE ALL OF THE LEARNING FROM THE CASE OF THAT WEEK AND RESPOND TO STUDENT QUESTIONS.", '
"AS A LINCOLNSHIRE GP, I AM PLEASED TO SEE STUDENTS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTLY ASK QUESTIONS AND GAIN EXPERIENCE FROM A PRACTISING DOCTOR IN THE EARLY YEAR OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAMME. I FEEL THIS HELPED CONSOLIDATE THEIR THEORETICAL LEARNING WITH REAL LIFE CASES WHICH I SEE IN MY DAILY PRACTICE. 
"THE CASE-BASED PLENARY SESSION WAS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO LEARN ABOUT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. I PERSONALLY FOUND THE EXPERIENCE REWARDING, THE STUDENTS WERE VERY ENGAGED, AND IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR LEARNING."
OPTIONAL MODULES ARE OFFERED IN ADDITION TO THE CORE CURRICULUM ON THE MEDICINE PROGRAMME FROM THE FIRST YEAR. THESE HELP TO PROVIDE MEDICAL STUDENTS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO STUDY SPECIFIC TOPICS IN GREATER DEPTH. EXAMPLES OF PREVIOUS OPTIONAL MODULES INCLUDE GLOBAL HEALTH, HISTORY OF MEDICINE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT, INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHIATRY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS, SAFEGUARDING, PROTECTION AND INTER-PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE: WORKING WITH VULNERABLE ADULTS, AND THE SCIENCE AND MYTHS OF SLEEP.
"IN A WORLD WHERE HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION IS NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED, WE MUST STRIVE TO UPHOLD THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION, THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH."
HISTORY OF MEDICINE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT
PROFESSOR ANNA MARIE ROOS, MODULE LEAD EXPLAINS: THIS SURVEY MODULE (UNDERTAKEN BY BOTH HISTORIANS AND FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS WITH SHARED LECTURES AND SEMINARS), ANALYSES HOW PHYSICIANS, OTHER PRACTITIONERS, AND THE PUBLIC UNDERSTOOD THE BODY, DISEASE, AND HEALTH FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE MODERN ERA.
"IT WAS OFFERED TO MEDICAL STUDENTS SO THEY COULD UNDERSTAND THE BACKSTORY OF THEIR PROFESSION, AS WELL AS TEACHING THEM TO WORK WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT DISCIPLINES TO IMPROVE THEIR ORAL AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATION SKILLS, IMPORTANT LATER FOR THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH PATIENTS AND COLLEAGUES."
IN SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR STUDENTS TOOK PART IN A TAILORED INDUCTION PROGRAMME TO INTRODUCE THEM TO THEIR COURSE AND THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL AND HEALTH CHALLENGES IN THE LINCOLNSHIRE REGION. THIS INCLUDED A NUMBER OF VISITS TO HEALTH AND EMERGENCY SERVICE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE COUNTY.
THIS VISIT FOCUSED ON THE EMERGENCY SERVICE RESPONSE TO DISASTERS WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING THE CO-ORDINATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED WHEN RESPONDING TO DISASTERS SUCH AS ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS OR FIRES. ACTIVITIES INCLUDED VISITING THE INCIDENT COMMAND SUITE AND HAVING A TOUR OF THE SITE AS WELL AS WITNESSING A SIMULATED SCENARIO OF A CAR ACCIDENT. STUDENTS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SIMULATION AND EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT USED IN RESCUE SITUATIONS.
THIS VISIT FOCUSED ON COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND INSHORE RESCUE. STUDENTS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THE ROYAL NATIONAL LIFEBOAT INSTITUTION AT MABLETHORPE WHERE THEY LISTENED TO TALKS ABOUT THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND VARIOUS RESCUE SCENARIOS. THEY WERE GIVEN A TOUR OF THE FACILITIES, THE BOATS, AND THE KIT USED IN RESCUE SITUATIONS. STUDENTS ALSO MANAGED TO SAMPLE SOME OF THE LOCAL FISH AND CHIPS!
OUR STUDENTS VISITED THE LINCOLNSHIRE AND NOTTINGHAMSHIRE AIR AMBULANCE WHERE THEY ENJOYED A TALK FROM A HELICOPTER EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE DOCTOR ABOUT EMERGENCY SERVICE OPERATIONS.  THIS HELPED OUR STUDENTS UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE CO-ORDINATION OF SERVICES REQUIRED WHEN RESPONDING TO DISASTERS SUCH AS ROAD TRAFFIC AND FARM ACCIDENTS, AS WELL AS THE CHALLENGES FACED BY EMERGENCY SERVICES WHEN ACCESSING REMOTE RURAL AREAS AND THE IMPACT THIS HAS ON EMERGENCY MEDICINE.

IN JANUARY 2024, DR JAMIE READ FHEA BMBS MACADMED MCLINED FRCP WAS APPOINTED AS THE INAUGURAL DEAN OF LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL.
THE LAST YEAR OF ENTRY FOR THE PROGRAMMES UNDER OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM WILL BE THE 2024/25 ACADEMIC YEAR FOR FOUNDATION YEAR (A18L), AND 2025/26 ACADEMIC YEAR FOR BMBS MEDICINE (A10L).
SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT WITH THE OFFICE FOR STUDENTS, FOR 2026 ENTRY WE WILL HAVE 80 PLACES AVAILABLE ON OUR MEDICINE MBCHB PROGRAMME AND 20 PLACES AVAILABLE ON OUR MEDICINE MBCHB WITH A GATEWAY YEAR PROGRAMME.
AS A CURRENT STUDENT YOU ARE REGISTERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM. LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL INDEPENDENCE WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR PROGRAMME OF STUDY AS THE TWO UNIVERSITIES IN THE PARTNERSHIP WILL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN GRADUATE WITH BMEDSCI AND BMBS (UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM).
IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GAINING A PLACE AT LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL TO START IN SEPTEMBER 2024, YOU WILL BE REGISTERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM. LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL INDEPENDENCE WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR PROGRAMME OF STUDY AS THE TWO UNIVERSITIES IN THE PARTNERSHIP WILL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN GRADUATE WITH BMEDSCI AND BMBS (UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM).
PLEASE BE AWARE THAT WE WILL NOT BE OFFERING THE A18L MEDICINE WITH A FOUNDATION YEAR PROGRAMME FOR 2025 ENTRY. IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GAINING A PLACE AT LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL ON THE A10L MEDICINE PROGRAMME TO START IN SEPTEMBER 2025, YOU WILL BE REGISTERED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM. LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL INDEPENDENCE WILL NOT AFFECT YOUR PROGRAMME OF STUDY AS THE TWO UNIVERSITIES IN THE PARTNERSHIP WILL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN GRADUATE WITH BMEDSCI AND BMBS (UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM).
LINCOLN MEDICAL SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2018 AS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO UNIVERSITIES, WITH THE STATED AIM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN TAKING OVER AS THE DEGREE AWARDING BODY IN DUE COURSE. OUR FIRST STUDENTS, ADMITTED IN SEPTEMBER 2019, ARE DUE TO GRADUATE WITH THEIR MEDICAL DEGREES IN JULY 2024; THIS MILESTONE IS A PROOF OF PRINCIPLE THAT MEDICAL STUDENTS CAN SUCCESSFULLY UNDERTAKE ALL OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING IN LINCOLNSHIRE AND SO THE PATH TO INDEPENDENCE IS NOW CLEAR.
WHILST THERE WILL BE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE CONTENT OF YEAR 0 IN THE NEW PROGRAMME, THE CHANGE IS MOSTLY SEMANTIC. CHANGING THE TITLE TO WITH A GATEWAY YEAR AVOIDS CONFUSION BETWEEN THIS PROGRAMME AND THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNS SCIENCE FOUNDATION YEAR, FOUNDATION DEGREES (WHICH MEDICAL SCHOOLS DO NOT OFFER) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM FOUNDATION PROGRAMME FOR GRADUATING DOCTORS (FY1/FY2).
ALL UK UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD MEDICINE DEGREES (PRIMARY MEDICAL QUALIFICATIONS) MUST BE ACCREDITED BY THE GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCIL (GMC), WHICH SETS THE STANDARDS FOR UNDERGRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION IN THE UK.
ALL NEW MEDICAL SCHOOLS ARE ON AN ACCREDITATION JOURNEY, AND THE GMC DO NOT PROVIDE FULL ACCREDITATION UNTIL THE FIRST COHORT OF STUDENTS ARE IN THEIR FINAL YEAR OF STUDY. ALL NEW SCHOOLS ARE THEREFORE REQUIRED TO HAVE A CONTINGENCY SCHOOL WHO CAN AWARD THEIR MEDICAL DEGREE IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT SOMETHING GOES WRONG.
IN OUR CASE, THE CONTINGENCY SCHOOL WILL BE THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM. FULL ACCREDITATION MEANS THAT GRADUATES CAN GAIN PROVISIONAL REGISTRATION WITH THE GMC AND A LICENCE TO PRACTISE MEDICINE IN THE UK; FULL REGISTRATION OF UK MEDICAL GRADUATES WITH THE GMC IS ONLY POSSIBLE AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE FIRST YEAR OF THE UK FOUNDATION PROGRAMME (FY1).
TECHNICALLY, YES. HOWEVER, THIS IS NO DIFFERENT TO THE SITUATION IN ALL NEW MEDICAL SCHOOLS, AND THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM WILL BE READY TO AWARD THE DEGREE IF REQUIRED.
ALL TEACHING AND LEARNING WILL BE MAPPED TO THE GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCILS OUTCOMES FOR GRADUATES AND LIST OF PRACTICAL SKILLS AND PROCEDURES, AND THE MEDICAL LICENSING ASSESSMENT CONTENT MAP. PHASE ONE WILL REPRESENT THE EARLY YEARS OF STUDY (YEARS 0-2) AND WILL AIM TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A SOLID BASE OF BIOMEDICAL, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND PROFESSIONAL SKILLS TO ENABLE THEM TO MAKE A SUCCESS OF THE REMAINDER OF THEIR STUDIES, AND WILL INCLUDE SOME CLINICAL PLACEMENT IN GP PRACTICES AND HOSPITALS.
PHASE TWO WILL REPRESENT THE TRANSITION TO FULL-TIME CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND INTRODUCE STUDENTS TO THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, SURGERY, PRIMARY CARE, PSYCHIATRY, CHILD HEALTH, WOMENS HEALTH, AND OTHER SPECIALTIES OVER YEARS THREE AND FOUR. PLACEMENTS WILL BE COMPLEMENTED BY SIMULATION IN BOTH THE CLINICAL AND THE UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT.
PHASE THREE WILL BE THE FINAL YEAR OF STUDY, WHERE STUDENTS CAN REINFORCE THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND DEVELOP FROM BEING PROTO-PROFESSIONALS TO THE SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL GRADUATES AND PRACTITIONERS OF THE FUTURE.
FULL UNIVERSITY APPROVAL OF OUR ADMISSIONS CRITERIA WILL NOT BE IN PLACE UNTIL SPRING 2025. HOWEVER, WE ARE UNLIKELY TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE CURRENT ADMISSIONS CRITERIA FOR A10L (IN THE CASE OF MEDICINE MBCHB) OR A18L (IN THE CASE OF MEDICINE WITH A GATEWAY YEAR MBCHB). PLEASE SEE OUR WEBSITE COURSE PAGES FOR FULL DETAILS.
THESE FAQS WILL BE REGULARLY UPDATED AS THE INDEPENDENCE PROJECT PROGRESSES. IN THE MEANTIME, IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS, PLEASE CONTACT US BY EMAIL AT LMSPROJECTSTEAM@LINCOLN.AC.UK.

S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS, NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.", '
THE SCHOOL RESEARCH COMMITTEE MEETS REGULARLY AND WILL DISCUSS ISSUES THAT CONCERN PGR STUDENTS. MEETING MINUTES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL PHD STUDENTS.
THE CURRENT PGR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE COMMITTEE ISDR BONAVENTURA MAJOLO. IF YOU WISH TO ADD SOMETHING TO THE AGENDA THEN PLEASE CONTACT YOUR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE.
YOUR MAIN SUPERVISOR WILL CONTINUALLY REVIEW YOUR PROGRESS. THE SCHOOL RESEARCH COMMITTEE ASSESSES THE PROGRESS OF ALL DOCTORAL STUDENTS EACH YEAR DURING THE SUMMER TERM. YOU WILL BE REQUIRED TO GIVE A 20 MINUTE PRESENTATION IN A SCHOOL INTERNAL SEMINAR (PERHAPS DURING A PGR SESSION IN THE ANNUAL STUDENT CONFERENCE). FOR EXAMPLE, AS A FIRST-YEAR STUDENT YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PRESENT A LITERATURE REVIEW AND/OR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, OR AS A SECOND-YEAR STUDENT YOU MAY DECIDE TO PRESENT ONE OF YOUR THESIS CHAPTERS OR A DRAFT JOURNAL MANUSCRIPT.
THIS ASSESSMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE REGISTRATION FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. FOR MOST STUDENTS, THE RECOMMENDATION WILL BE TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR CURRENT STATUS. FOR SOME, WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR EMPIRICAL WORK AND ARE WRITING UP THEIR THESIS, THE RECOMMENDATION WILL BE TO MOVE TO THESIS PENDING FEES STATUS (PLEASE CONSULT WITH RESEARCH DEGREES HANDBOOK). HOWEVER, EXCEPTIONALLY THE RECOMMENDATION WILL BE TO TERMINATE THE STUDENTS DOCTORAL PROGRAMME.
ENTRY INTO THE NEXT YEAR OF A DOCTORAL PROGRAMME IS CONDITIONAL ON EVIDENCE THAT THE STUDENT IS ENGAGING SUCCESSFULLY WITH DOCTORAL STUDY AND LIKELY TO SUBMIT A HIGH QUALITY THESIS WITHIN THE PERIOD OF MAXIMUM REGISTRATION INDICATED IN YOUR ORIGINAL OFFER LETTER. TO MAKE SUCH A RECOMMENDATION THE SCHOOL RESEARCH COMMITTEE MUST BE ASSURED THAT THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF YOUR WORK OVER THE ACADEMIC YEAR IS COMMENSURATE WITH THE AWARD OF A DOCTORAL DEGREE. THE SOURCE OF EVIDENCE INCLUDES (1) YOUR PRESENTATION/REPORT ON WORK COMPLETED DURING THE ACADEMIC YEAR, AND (2) YOUR MAIN SUPERVISORS REPORT.
CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND RESEARCH TRAINING IS EXPENSIVE. THE SCHOOL IS FULLY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING THE WORK OF ALL PGR STUDENTS AND EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO SUPPORT REALISTIC RESEARCH PLANS. PROBLEMS IN RELATION TO FUNDING OR RESOURCES SHOULD BE FIRST RAISED WITH YOUR MAIN SUPERVISOR WHO MAY THEN CONSULT THE DIRECTOR OF PGR AND THE SCHOOL RESEARCH COMMITTEE.
UPON CONFIRMATION OF YOUR REGISTRATION, YOU WILL BE ALLOCATED A DESK AREA AND A COMPUTER IN THE SCHOOL POSTGRADUATE ROOM. YOU HAVE RIGHTS TO ACCESS SCHOOL TEACHING AND RESEARCH RESOURCES, SUCH AS STATIONARY, PRINTING/PHOTOCOPY COSTS, SCHOOL DATABASE OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND OTHER EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS, SCHOOL-OWNED EQUIPMENT, AND TECHNICIAN HELP.
OUT OF HOURS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BEFORE 8AM OR AFTER 6PM WEEKDAYS, AT WEEKENDS OR DURING UNIVERSITY CLOSURE DAYS. WHERE POSSIBLE, WE WOULD ENCOURAGE POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS NOT TO WORK ALONE OUT OF HOURS. IN THE CASE OF POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS AND POSTDOCS IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE MAIN SUPERVISOR TO ENSURE THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS RECEIVED TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT RESEARCH SAFELY OUT OF HOURS AND THAT THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.
IF POSSIBLE, RESEARCH SHOULD NOT BE CONDUCTED OUT OF HOURS, ALTHOUGH IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS MAY BE NECESSARY BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE RESEARCH (INCLUDING PRESSURE ON EQUIPMENT, SUBJECT RECRUITMENT). ALL RESEARCH CONDUCTED OUT OF HOURS SHOULD HAVE UNDERGONE A RISK ASSESSMENT BY YOUR MAIN SUPERVISOR. 
THE SCHOOL SUPPORTS A HIGH LEVEL OF RESEARCH ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS KINDS THAT IS RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGY AND THIS IS REFLECTED BY WEEKLYSCHOOL RESEARCH SEMINARAND ROUTINE RESEARCH GROUP MEETINGS. THE SCHOOL WORKS WELL WHEN ITS MEMBERS ARE NOT ONLY GETTING ON WELL WITH THEIR OWN PARTICULAR ENDEAVOURS BUT ALSO TAKING AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING. NEW IDEAS AND INSIGHT ABOUT ONE'S OWN RESEARCH PROBLEM CAN ARISE FROM UNDERSTANDING IDEAS FROM A DIFFERENT AREA IN PSYCHOLOGY OR RELATED DISCIPLINE. CONSEQUENTLY RESEARCH STUDENTS ARE EXPECTED TO ATTEND ALL SCHOOL RESEARCH SEMINARS AND THEIR OWN RESEARCH GROUP MEETINGS. PHD STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO GO FOR DINNER WITH THE EXTERNAL SPEAKERS WHEN THE SPEAKER'S TALK IS RELATED TO THEIR RESEARCH AREA.
AWARD OF A DOCTORATE DEGREE INDICATES THAT A RESEARCHER HAS DEVELOPED ADVANCED SKILLS IN CONDUCTING AND COMMUNICATING SPECIALISED RESEARCH. RESEARCHERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT AND DISCUSS THEIR RESEARCH. THE BEST WAY TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED PRESENTER IS TO BEGIN WITH A SMALL, SUPPORTIVE AND FAMILIAR AUDIENCE OF THE KIND PROVIDED BY SUPERVISORS, SUPPORTIVE FACULTY AND FELLOW POSTGRADUATES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU PRESENT YOUR WORK TO YOUR RESEARCH GROUP AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR, ESPECIALLY AT THE KEY STAGES OF YOUR STUDY, SUCH AS AT THE COMPLETION OF YOUR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, OR AT THE COMPLETION OF DATA ANALYSIS OF YOUR FIRST MAJOR STUDY. IN ADDITION, YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO PRESENT YOUR WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY ANNUAL POSTGRADUATE CONFERENCE.
PRIOR PRACTICE IS VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WRITING A THESIS. YOU SHOULD BEGIN WRITING IN YOUR FIRST YEAR. YOU ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO SUBMIT YOUR WORK TO RELEVANT JOURNALS FROM YOUR SECOND YEAR ONWARDS. IT IS USUALLY HELPFUL TO INCLUDE YOUR SUPERVISOR AS A CO-AUTHOR AND LEARN FROM HIS/HER APPROACH TO PUBLISHING RESEARCH PAPERS. DISCUSSING REVIEWERS COMMENTS (AND HOW TO RESPOND TO THEM) WITH YOUR SUPERVISOR IS AN ESPECIALLY USEFUL LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN PREPARING YOURSELF TO DEFEND YOUR THESIS. ADDING PUBLISHED (OR IN PRESS) TO YOUR CURRICULUM VITAE BEFORE YOU FINISH YOUR DOCTORATE WILL ALSO HELP YOU COMPETE FOR POSTDOCTORAL POSITIONS.
KEY PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOL RELATED TO POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH (PGR):
YOUR FIRST/MAIN SUPERVISOR IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF YOUR STUDY. YOU AND YOUR MAIN SUPERVISOR ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING YOUR WORK SO THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR THESIS WITHIN AN AGREED PERIOD OF FUNDING (E.G., THE FUNDED PERIOD OR WITHIN 5 YEARS FOR SELF-FUNDED FULL-TIME STUDENTS AND 8 YEARS FOR PART-TIME STUDENTS). YOU ALSO HAVE SECOND SUPERVISOR (AND IN SOME CASES A THIRD SUPERVISOR) WHO COMPLEMENTS THE EXPERTISE OF THE MAIN SUPERVISOR. SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS WITH SECOND SUPERVISORS ARE COORDINATED BY MAIN SUPERVISORS.
YOU ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE REGULAR SUPERVISION IN FACE-TO-FACE, EMAIL OR TELEPHONE MEETINGS. FORMAL FACE-TO-FACE SUPERVISION MEETINGS SHOULD OCCUR AT LEAST ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS. THE UNIVERSITY REQUIRES THATALLSUCH FORMAL SUPERVISION MEETINGS BETWEEN PGR STUDENTS AND THEIR SUPERVISORS ARE DOCUMENTED. YOUR SUPERVISOR CAN EXPLAIN THIS PROCESS TO YOU AND YOU CAN CONSULT WITH YOUR RESEARCH DEGREES HANDBOOK.
IT IS GOOD PRACTICE FOR YOU TO KEEP A RECORD OF ALL YOUR SUPERVISION MEETINGS INCLUDING A BRIEF NOTE OF TOPICS DISCUSSED AND ACTIONS AGREED. YOUR SUPERVISOR CAN CHECK THIS FOR YOU FROM TIME TO TIME.
VERY OCCASIONALLY, PROBLEMS ARISE IN A SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A STUDENT'S INTERESTS CHANGE, OR FOR OTHER REASONS, THE ASSIGNMENT OF A SUPERVISOR NO LONGER SEEMS SUITABLE. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POSSIBILITY OF CHANGING SUPERVISOR SHOULD BE DISCUSSED BY STUDENT AND SUPERVISOR AND WITH THE DIRECTOR OF PGR. IT IS NOT GOOD PRACTICE TO DISCUSS SUCH PROBLEMS WITH OTHER FACULTY MEMBERS. INITIALLY, ANY SUCH PROBLEMS SHOULD BE EXPLICITLY DISCUSSED WITH YOUR SUPERVISORS IN SUPERVISION TIME. AREAS OF AGREEMENT AND DISAGREEMENT SHOULD BE LISTED AND, IDEALLY, AGREED UPON IN WRITING. IF PROBLEMS PERSIST, THE PGR STUDENT SHOULD DISCUSS THESE WITH THE DIRECTOR OF PGR (KUN GUO). YOU MAY ALSO FIND IT HELPFUL TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH A STUDENT ADVISOR AT THE STUDENT CENTRE.
PLEASE NOTE THAT WE EXPECT POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS TO SUBMIT THEIR THESES WITHIN THEIR FUNDED PERIOD. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO YOUR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT PROSPECTS. IT IS NOT IN STUDENTS OR THE SCHOOLS INTERESTS FOR STUDENTS TO BE LATE IN SUBMITTING THEIR THESES.
SEMINARS AND PRACTICAL CLASSES PLAY A LARGE PART IN THE UNDERGRADUATE PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAMMES. GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANTS ARE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE UP TO 6 HOURS PER TEACHING WEEK AS PART OF THEIR CONTRACT WITH THE SCHOOL. OTHER PHD STUDENTS WHO ARE PART-FUNDED BY INTERNAL SCHOOL FUNDS ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO ENGAGE IN SOME TEACHING. SUBJECT TO SCHOOL FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT, SELF-FUNDED STUDENT COULD ALSO BE ENCOURAGED TO TAKE SOME TEACHING ACTIVITIES. HAVING SOME TEACHING EXPERIENCE CAN BE VERY HELPFUL LATER IN YOUR CAREER, WHEN APPLYING FOR ACADEMIC POSITIONS. DOCTORAL STUDENTS TEACHING HOURS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT THEIR TEACHING WORKLOAD DOES NOT COMPROMISE THEIR RESEARCH PROGRESS.
SOME OF THEM ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS FROM THE COLLEGE OF ARTS, SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES. IF YOU NEED SPECIFIC SUBJECT-RELATED TRAINING, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR SUPERVISOR.
WE ARE AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF DEVELOPMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGISTS WHO INVESTIGATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF COGNITIVE, LANGUAGE, SOCIAL, EMOTIONAL, MOTOR AND BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES THAT AFFECT INTERPERSONAL, INTERGROUP, AND INTERSPECIES ATTITUDES, COGNITION, EMOTION, AND BEHAVIOUR.
OUR RESEARCH IS DIFFERENT 
AS WELL AS DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTING THEORY AND KNOWLEDGE TO DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY, OUR WORK HAS SIGNIFICANT AND WIDE-RANGING IMPACTS ON REAL WORLD ISSUES, POLICY, AND PRACTICE. MEMBERS OF OUR RESEARCH GROUP HAVE RECEIVED PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS AND GRANTS FROM A RANGE OF FUNDING BODIES, INCLUDING ESRC, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, THE PRIMATE SOCIETY OF GREAT BRITAIN, THE LEAKEY FOUNDATION. WE HAVE ALSO REPEATEDLY WON PRESTIGIOUS FUNDING FROM CHARITIES AND INDUSTRY, E.G., FROM WALTHAM AND MARS. OUR GROUP MEMBERS ACTIVELY ENGAGE IN CONSULTANCY WORK FOR GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS, BUSINESSES, AND THIRD-SECTOR ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION, GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, PEOPLE UNITED, DEPARTMENT FOR WORK AND PENSIONS, THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE, AND THE LEADERSHIP FOUNDATION FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. WE ALSO ORGANISE WORKSHOPS AND HOLD PUBLIC TALKS AND EVENTS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS THE SUMMER SCIENTIST FOR FAMILIES OR STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOPS ON SAFE ANIMAL-ASSISTED INTERVENTIONS.
WE BELIEVE THERE IS CLEAR SCIENTIFIC VALUE IN CROSSING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PSYCHOLOGY AND TRADITIONALLY DISTINCT SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES SUCH AS ANTHROPOLOGY, ECONOMICS, LINGUISTICS, ETHOLOGY, MEDICINE, VETERINARY MEDICINE, PHYSIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY. OUR ACADEMIC STAFF AND COMMUNITY OF POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS COLLABORATE WITH RESEARCHERS AT NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITIES, CHARITIES AND BUSINESSES.

THE LINCOLN INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT LAB OPENED IN 2000 AND RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONCENTRATING ON DIFFERENT AREAS OF CATEGORISATION AND CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS SPEECH PERCEPTION AND LANGUAGE ACQUISITION, ESPECIALLY WORD LEARNING AND EARLY GRAMMAR.
OTHER RESEARCH FOCUSES ON INJURY PREVENTION - ESPECIALLY ON THE PREVENTION OF DOG BITE INJURIES. HERE, WE ASSESSED THE BLUE DOG BITE PREVENTION PROGRAMME, WWW.THEBLUEDOG.ORGAND WE HAVE CARRIED OUT FURTHER RESEARCH PROJECTS ON CHILDREN'S MISINTERPRETATION OF DOGS' FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, ON WHY CHILDREN GET BITTEN IN THE FACE, HEAD AND NECK AREA MORE OFTEN. WE HAVE ALSO UNDERTAKEN EYE-TRACKING STUDIES OF CHILDREN'S LOOKING AT DOG FACES AND PAST AND ONGOING RESEARCH ALSO INVESTIGATES CHILDREN'S AND ADULTS' PERCEPTION OF DOG SIGNALLINGAND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BITE PREVENTION IN THE HOME WITH A FAMILIAR DOG.

THESE ARE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WE ARE TRYING TO ANSWER. BY INVESTIGATING INFANTS' EARLY CATEGORISATION BEHAVIOUR AND THEIR EARLY LINGUISTIC CAPABILITIES WE HOPE TO GAIN MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW BABIES CATEGORISE THE WORLD, HOW THEIR CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT GROWS AND ABOUT HOW LANGUAGE EVOLVES FROM EARLIEST SPEECH PERCEPTION UP TO FULL-BLOWN GRAMMARS.
PREFERENTIAL LOOKING:BABIES PARTICIPATING IN OUR STUDIES SIT ON THEIR PARENT'S LAP IN FRONT OF A SCREEN SIMILAR TO A CINEMA SCREEN FOR ABOUT 2-5 MINUTES. THEY SEE IMAGES OF OBJECTS (E.G. A CUP) OR ANIMALS (E.G. A CAT) AND HEAR A FRIENDLY, FEMALE VOICE SAYING "LOOK, LOOK AT THE CUP" (OR CAT ETC.).
PREFERENTIAL LISTENING: HERE, CHILDREN SIT ON THEIR PARENT'S LAP AND LOOK AT LIGHTS TO THEIR RIGHT AND TO THEIR LEFT WHILE THEY HEAR SPEECH SOUNDS OR WORDS. WHILE THE CHILD IS WATCHING THE IMAGES ON THE SCREENS IN PREFERENTIAL LOOKING, OR LOOKING AT THE LIGHTS IN PREFERENTIAL LISTENING, WE RECORD THE DIRECTION THE CHILD IS LOOKING IN TO DISCOVER WHAT HE OR SHE UNDERSTANDS.
SOME OF THE KEY AREAS IN EARLY WORD LEARNING ARE THE FOLLOWING:
WHAT IS GOING ON IN BABIES' MINDS WHEN THEY SHOW EVIDENCE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE WORD "BIRD"? WHAT IS THE WORD CONNECTED TO? ALL BIRDS? ONLY THE BIRD THEY SAW ONCE? THEIR GRANDMOTHER'S CANARY? HOW SOON DO THEY LEARN TO CONNECT ATYPICAL BIRDS LIKE OSTRICHES AND PENGUINS WITH THE WORD "BIRD"? WE INVESTIGATE HOW INFANTS AND CHILDREN CATEGORISE OBJECTS AND IF THEY PREFER TYPICAL TO ATYPICAL OBJECTS/ANIMALS (E.G. A SPARROW VERSUS AN OSTRICH) AT DIFFERENT STAGES IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. LOOKING AT THE ROLE OF TYPICALITY EFFECTS IN EARLY WORD LEARNING GIVES US VALUABLE INSIGHTS INTO WHAT THESE EARLY WORDS REFER TO. WE ARE INVESTIGATING ESPECIALLY THE
AS CONTEXT ALSO PLAYS A BIG ROLE IN CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH IN THE LINCOLN INFANT AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT LABALSO FOCUSES ON CONTEXT EFFECTS. USING PREFERENTIAL LOOKING, WE HOPE TO FIND OUT IN HOW FAR ADULTS AND CHILDREN CAN BE INFLUENCED IN THEIR CATEGORISATION OF OBJECTS BY DIFFERENT CONTEXTS.
FOR THIS PROJECT, THE FIRST IN THIS COUNTRY, WE NEED PARENTS OF CHILDREN AGED 8 TO 18 MONTHS FROM ALL ACROSS THE UK. VOLUNTEER PARENTS WILL BE ASKED TO TELL US WHICH WORDS THEIR CHILDREN UNDERSTAND AND SAY AND WHICH GESTURES THEY DO BY FILLING IN OUR NEW UK-CDI CHECKLIST.

THE RESEARCH IN THE EYE-TRACKING LABORATORY IS FOCUSED ON INFERENTIAL PROCESS IN VISION, SOCIAL ATTENTION AND COGNITION, WHICH INVESTIGATES HOW VISUAL COGNITION IS SHAPED AND INFLUENCED BY OUR ENVIRONMENT, EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE. WE ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING HOW WE MOVE THE EYES TO SELECT AND LOOK AT SALIENT VISUAL CUES AROUND US TO UNDERSTAND OUR SURROUNDINGS, HOW THESE CUES ARE PROCESSED IN THE BRAIN AND FURTHER USED TO GUIDE OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE TASKS SUCH AS FACE RECOGNITION, EMOTION RECOGNITION, BODY PERCEPTION, AND SCENE UNDERSTANDING.
ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM STUDIES ARE WELL USED IN PSYCHOLOGY TO ASCERTAIN ACTIVATION PATTERNS IN THE BRAIN IN RESPONSE TO STIMULI TO SEE WHEN AND WHERE PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE RESPONDING. STUDIES IN THE PAST AND CURRENTLY HAVE CENTRED AROUND VISUAL DISCOMFORT, NOISE, INVESTIGATING SPATIAL FREQUENCY PERCEPTION, MIGRAINES, VISUAL RESPONSE TO VISUAL ILLUSIONS AND NATURAL IMAGES, AS WELL AS PERCEPTION OF MOTION AND BODY LANGUAGE. EEG ALLOWS ELECTRODES TO BE PLACED ONTO THE SCALP USING A CONDUCTIVE GEL AND A CAP TO POSITION THE ELECTRODES WITH. THE SCHOOL HAS RECENTLY ACQUIRED A NEW ACTIVETWO BIOSEMI SYSTEM AND ALSO HOUSES A SECOND BIOSEMI SYSTEM. THERE ARE EEG SETS AVAILABLE FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN AS WELL FOR STUDIES INVOLVING YOUNGER PARTICIPANTS.

THIS LAB LOOKS AT STUDIES OF MOTION, COLOUR AND COLOUR CONSTANCY PERCEPTION AS WELL AS REACTIONS TO VISUAL STIMULI. THE LAB HOUSES A SET OF HIGH REFRESH RATE MONITORS AND PARTICIPANTS WILL LOOK AT A RANGE OF VIDEOS AND IMAGE STIMULI WHILE MAKING RESPONSES ABOUT THEIR OWN PERCEPTION IN RELATION TO THE STIMULI. STUDIES LOOKING AT SPECIFIC VISUAL ILLUSIONS, ESPECIALLY AROUND COLOUR HAVE ALSO BEEN OF INTEREST.
THIS LABHOUSES A DRIVING SIMULATOR SET UP WITH A WIDESCREEN MONITOR AND A FULLY INTEGRATED SIMULATED DRIVING SEAT WITH ADJUSTABLE AND MOVABLE PARAMETERS. THERE ARE A RANGE OF DRIVING SIMULATORS USED IN SOFTWARE BUT ARE ADAPTABLE TO NECESSARY TASKS. CURRENT STUDIES INVOLVE LOOKING AT A RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE RATED HIGHER ON THE AUTISTIC SPECTRUM, AND ANALYSING EYETRACKING, PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL DATA SUCH AS DRIVING PERFORMANCE ON STANDARDISED TASKS AS WELL AS HEAD TRACKING AND OBJECT RECOGNITION.
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN HAS A GROWING NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS WITH UNIVERSITIES AND PARTNER INSTITUTIONS FROM EUROPE AND AROUND THE WORLD OFFERING ERASMUS+ AND STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMMES.
RESEARCH ON BOTH EF DIFFICULTIES AND EYE GAZE HAVE SO FAR PRODUCED MIXED FINDINGS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE FIRM EVIDENCE OF DRIVING OUTCOMES IN AUTISM AS BEING ABLE TO DRIVE IS A KEY STEP TO BECOMING INDEPENDENT AND ENHANCES THE CHANCE OF FINDING EMPLOYMENT. THE DVLA RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW RESTRICTIONS ON LICENCE APPLICATIONS FROM THOSE WITH AUTISM. THE OUTCRY THAT RESULTED LED THEM TO QUICKLY BACKDOWN. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER FOR AUTISTIC PEOPLE, AND BEFORE SUCH DECISIONS ARE TAKEN THERE NEEDS TO BE SOLID EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE DIAGNOSED AND THOSE NOT. IT MAY ULTIMATELY LEAD TO BETTER TRAINING BASED ON IDENTIFIED DEFICITS WHETHER IN AUTISTIC OR NEUROTYPICAL DRIVERS.
NEURAL OSCILLATIONS ARE RHYTHMIC PATTERNS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY VISIBLE IN ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC (EEG) RECORDINGS OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY ON THE HUMAN SCALP. OSCILLATIONS IN THE ALPHA-BAND - APPROXIMATELY WITH A FREQUENCY RANGE OF 8-13 HZ - ARE THE MOST PROMINENT OF THESE RHYTHMIC PATTERNS, AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REFLECT BIASING OF ATTENTION. DURING VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION TASKS IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS COVERTLY ATTEND TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT HEMIFIELD OF VISUAL SPACE, THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE POWER OF ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS SHIFTS ACCORDINGLY. SPECIFICALLY, ALPHA POWER INCREASES OVER PARIETO-OCCIPITAL CORTEX CONTRALATERAL TO THE TO-BE-IGNORED REGION OF SPACE RELATIVE TO WHEN THAT SAME REGION OF SPACE IS ATTENDED TO. HOWEVER, ALPHA-BAND OSCILLATIONS ARE DO NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THE BRAIN EXHIBITS ACTIVITY OVER A WIDE RANGE OF FREQUENCIES, AND OVERALL CHANGES IN THAT ACTIVITY MAY BE CONFLATED WITH CHANGES IN A PARTICULAR RANGE. THIS PROJECT WILL USE EEG TO RECORD ELECTRICAL SIGNALS ORIGINATING FROM THE BRAIN WHILE PARTICIPANTS PERFORM COVERT SPATIAL ATTENTION TASKS. IT WILL EXAMINE WHETHER THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN ALPHA-BAND ACTIVITY DURING THESE TASKS REFLECT BROADER CHANGES ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM OF BRAIN ACTIVITY.
PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED ATTENTIONAL FUNCTIONS AFTER ACTION VIDEO-GAME TRAINING, E.G. WHEN TRACKING MULTIPLE MOVING OBJECTS. IN THE STUDY WE AIM AT INVESTIGATING THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF MULTIPLE OBJECT TRACKING IN VIDEO GAME PLAYERS COMPARED TO NON-PLAYERS. TO THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL RECORD ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL CORRELATES OF TRACKING MULTIPLE MOVING OBJECTS IN 16ACTION VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (AVGPS), 16 NON-ACTION VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (NAVGPS) AND 16 NON-VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (I.E., CONTROLS; CONS). PARTICIPANTS ARE PRESENTED WITH BLUE AND YELLOW CARTOON FACES MOVING AROUND A SCREEN AND TOLD TO KEEP TRACK OF THE BLUE FACES. ALL THE FACES THEN CHANGE COLOUR TO YELLOW BUT VOLUNTEERS ARE ASKED TO STILL KEEP TRACK OF THE FACES THAT WERE INITIALLY BLUE. DURING THIS PHASE DIFFERENT TARGET CUES ARE PRESENTED, WHICH CONSIST OF A COLOUR CHANGE, AN AUDITORY CUE OR AN AUDITORY-VISUAL CUE. WE EXPECT GAMERS TO SHOW IMPROVED PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO NON-VIDEO GAME PLAYERS. MOREOVER, WE EXPECT MODULATIONS OF THE ERP COMPONENTS WHICH ARE LOCALIZED IN AREAS OF THE ATTENTIONAL NETWORK. THIS STUDY ALLOWS TO INVESTIGATE NEURAL CHANGES UNDERLYING ATTENTIONAL CAPACITY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH IMPROVED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE VIDEO GAME PLAYING.
PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED COGNITIVE AND PERCEPTUAL FUNCTIONS AFTER ACTION VIDEO-GAME TRAINING. IN THE STUDY WE AIM AT INVESTIGATING THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF VISUAL WORKING MEMORY IN VIDEO GAME PLAYERS COMPARED TO NON-PLAYERS. TO THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL RECORD ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL CORRELATES OF VISUAL WORKING MEMORY UNDER LOW AND HIGH LOAD CONDITIONS IN 16 ACTION VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (AVGPS), 16 NONACTION VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (NAVGPS) AND 16 NON-VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (I.E., CONTROLS; CONS). IN THE HIGH LOAD CONDITION, FOUR DIFFERENT GABORS (I.E., ORIENTED STIMULI) WILL BE PRESENTED IN EACH VISUAL QUADRANT, WHEREAS IN THE LOW-LOAD CONDITION ONLY TWO GABORS WILL BE PRESENTED IN ONE VISUAL HEMI-FIELD. AFTER A SPECIFIC TIME INTERVAL, A PROBE STIMULUS WILL BE PRESENTED AND PARTICIPANTS HAVE TO REPORT THE ORIENTATION OF THE SPATIALLY CUED GABOR. IN GENERAL, WE EXPECT THAT VIDEO GAME PLAYERS (I.E., AVGPS AND NAVGPS) OUTPERFORM CONS, ESPECIALLY UNDER THE HIGH MEMORY LOAD CONDITION. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO VIDEO GAME GROUPS WILL ALSO BE ASSESSED. MOREOVER, WE EXPECT MODULATIONS OF THE ERP COMPONENTS GENERATED IN THE FRONTOPARIETAL NETWORK. THIS STUDY ALLOWS TO INVESTIGATE NEURAL CHANGES UNDERLYING VISUAL WORKING MEMORY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH IMPROVED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS FOLLOWING EXTENSIVE VIDEO GAME PLAYING.
HUMANS IN CLOSE RELATIONS OFTEN DEVELOP SIMILAR PREFERENCE/TASTE OF ATTRACTIVENESS OR AESTHETIC JUDGEMENT. THIS PROJECT WILL EXAMINE WHETHER DOGS AND THEIR OWNERS PREFER THE SAME VISUAL TRAITS THAT DEFINING AESTHETIC AND ATTRACTIVENESS. WE WILL USE BEHAVIOURAL MEASUREMENTS (E.G. DOG APPROACH SPEED, APPROACH ORDER/SEQUENCE TO STIMULI) TO EXAMINE WHETHER DOGS AGREE WITH THEIR OWNERS RATING OF AESTHETIC OR FACE ATTRACTIVENESS, AND WHETHER THERE IS A SPECIES-SPECIFIC PREFERENCES FOR ATTRACTIVENESS BASED ON GENERAL PERCEPTUAL MECHANISMS.
THE BEHAVIOURAL ECOLOGY VIEW PROPOSED BY FRIDLUND (1994) SUGGESTS THAT FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE NOT JUST AS INDICATORS OF CURRENT EMOTIONAL STATE, BUT ARE ALSO INDICATORS OF FUTURE BEHAVIOUR. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, WE CAN ARGUE THAT HUMAN FACIAL EXPRESSIONS MIGHT BE USED BY THE DOGS TO ADJUST THEIR BEHAVIOUR BASED ON THE LIKELY FUTURE BEHAVIOUR OF THE HUMAN. THIS PROJECT WILL LOOK AT HOW WELL DOGS CAN UNDERSTAND THE COMMUNICATIVE AND PREDICATIVE VALUE OF FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, AND HOW LIKELY THEYCAN USE THEIR UNDERSTANDING TO GUIDE THEIR APPROACH/ AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOUR AND THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH HUMAN.
THE INCREASING PRESENCE OF PET, ASSISTANCE AND THERAPY ANIMALS (E.G. DOGS AND CATS) IN OUR SOCIETY REQUIRES OUR TIMELY INTERPRETATION OF EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION IN ANIMALS, WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL FOR SAFE AND REWARDING HUMAN-ANIMAL INTERACTION AND TO ENSURE ANIMAL WELFARE. WE HOPE TO BRING TOGETHER THE CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ANALYSIS, EYE-TRACKING, VIRTUAL REALITY AND BRAIN IMAGING (YOU CAN USE ONE OR TWO METHODOLOGIES BASED ON YOUR PERSONAL INTEREST), IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE OVERARCHING OBJECTIVES OF UNDERSTANDING WHETHER HUMANS PROCESS HUMAN AND ANIMAL EMOTIONAL CUES IN A SIMILAR MANNER AT PERCEPTUAL, COGNITIVE, NEURAL AND BEHAVIOURAL LEVELS. YOU CAN EITHER RESEARCH ON ONE OF MY ALREADY-PLANNED PROJECTS OR COME UP WITH YOUR OWN PROJECT.
CONTEMPORARY ATTACHMENT THEORY FOCUSES ON COGNITIVE AND AFFECTIVE PROCESSING (CRITTENDEN, 2000) AND HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF ADULT RELATIONSHIPS, INCLUDING ADULT-ADULT RELATIONSHIPS (HOWE, 2011). ATTACHMENT THEORY IS CURRENTLY BEING APPLIED IN AREAS SUCH AS CLINICAL PRACTICE (BARAZZONE, SANTOS, MCGOWAN & DONAGHAY-SPIRE, 2019), MENTORING (GERMAIN, 2011; GORMLEY, 2011), SCHOOLS (KEARNS & HART, 2018; PARKER & LEVINSON, 2018) AND EXTENSIVELY WITHIN THE ASSESSMENT, APPROVAL AND MONITORING OF FOSTERERS AND ADOPTERS IN THE UK (DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, 2000). AN AREA THAT APPEARS LESS EXPLORED IS THE CAPACITY OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS TO MEET THE ATTACHMENT NEEDS OF ADULTS AND HOW FRIENDSHIP CHOICE, DEVELOPMENT AND LOSS MAPS ON TO THE ATTACHMENT SYSTEM. THIS PROJECT WOULD AIM TO BEGIN SUCH AN EXPLORATION, VIA SELF-REPORT MEASURES, POTENTIALLY COMBINING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS. DETAILS OF THE PRECISE FOCUS AND METHOD REMAIN TO BE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE SUPERVISOR AND SUPERVISEE, DEPENDING ON WHERE THEIR INTERESTS INTERSECT.
THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT SPEECH SHARES SOME NEURONAL PROCESSES WITH FINE MOTOR MOVEMENT. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS SEQUENCING, MOTOR TIMING AND COORDINATION, WHICH FORM THE BASIS OF THE SPEECH-MOTOR SYSTEM, MAY UNDERLIE THESE SHARED PROCESSES. A SERIES OF RECENT INFLUENTIAL PAPERS FROM THE LINCOLN TRANCRANIAL DOPPLER LAB HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THEORETICAL MODEL DESCRIBING A LEFT LATERALISED SPEECH-PRAXIS CENTRE, WHICH IS SUGGESTED TO UNDERPIN THE COMMONALITIES IN INFORMATION PROCESSING ACROSS SEQUENTIAL SPEECH AND MOTOR OUTPUT. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE WORK EXPLORING PRECISELY WHICH ASPECTS OF THESE FUNCTIONS ARE MOST CLOSELY RELATED TO THIS LEFT LATERALISED ASYMMETRY. THERE IS A NEED TO EXTEND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF LEFT HEMISPHERIC SPECIALISATION UNDERLYING SPEECH/MOTOR PROCESSES IN ORDER TO ACCURATELY ASSESS CLINICAL COHORTS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL AND ACQUIRED DISORDERS OF LANGUAGE AND MOTOR FUNCTION. THIS WILL INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING COMORBID DEFICITS IN LANGUAGE AND MOTOR COORDINATION IN SUCH GROUPS, AND REFINE INVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE FUNCTIONING ACROSS DOMAINS. THE PROPOSED PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE THE NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDING OF FUNCTIONAL CEREBRAL LATERALITY FOR LANGUAGE AND MOTOR PROCESSING. SPECIFICALLY, THE SHARED NEURONAL PROCESSES UNDERLYING SPEECH AND MOTOR PRAXIS WILL BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED, ALONGSIDE THE IMPACT OF ATYPICAL LATERALISATION ON LANGUAGE AND MOTOR ABILITIES.
PERCEPTUAL CHRONOMETER' AS A DEVICE WHICH ALLOWS THE MEASUREMENT OF TEMPORAL RESOLUTION. I WOULD LIKE TO USE THIS IDEA IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE CONCEPT FURTHER. FIRST, I AM INTERESTED IN WHETHER TEMPORAL RESOLUTION VARIES WITH AGE, SO COMPARING CHILDREN, YOUNG, AND OLDER ADULTS. SECOND, I PLAN TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT MANIPULATIONS (E.G., CONSUMING SUGAR, CAFFEINE, ETC.) WHICH MIGHT INCREASE OR DECREASE TEMPORAL RESOLUTION IN ADULTS.", 'DR. BONAVENTURA MAJOLO (BMAJOLO@LINCOLN.AC.UK)
INGROUP COOPERATION IS PREDICTED TO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR AFFECTING THE OUTCOME OF BETWEEN-GROUP COMPETITION. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER INGROUP COOPERATION SPONTANEOUSLY EMERGES AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, IT IS DUE TO GROUP STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION (E.G. INGROUP COHESION OR FAMILIARITY BETWEEN GROUP MEMBERS) AND/OR TO POLICING (E.G. PUNISHMENT OF NON-COOPERATIVE MEMBERS). THIS PROJECT AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THESE UNCLEAR ASPECTS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INGROUP COOPERATION AND OUTGROUP COMPETITION USING SPORT TEAMS. THE DATA COLLECTION WILL FOCUS ON HOW TEAM SPORT PLAYERS BEHAVE DURING COMPETITIVE GAMES IN A SERIES OF COMPETITIVE MATCHES ORGANISED IN THE SPORTS HALL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. THIS PROJECT IS INTERDISCIPLINARY IN NATURE, INVOLVING RESEARCHERS FROM SPORT AND COMPUTER SCIENCE.
WORD LEARNING IN THE DOG HAS SO FAR FOCUSED ON WORDS REFERRING TO OBJECTS. IN THIS PROJECT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT THE DOGS ABILITY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WORD MEANINGS BASED ON ADJECTIVES: BIG/SMALL, AND DARK/LIGHT. EVIDENCE IN RELATION TO WORD LEARNING FOR WORDS REFERRING TO OBJECTS HAS SHOWN THAT THE BORDER COLLIE IS SENSITIVE TO SIZE DIFFERENCES IN OBJECTS (VAN DER ZEE ET AL, 2013). THE VISUAL SYSTEM OF THE DOG IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHITE/BLACK, WITH THE DOGS COLOUR VISION BEING LIMITED TO THE BLUE/YELLOW SPECTRUM. THESE TWO PIECES OF INFORMATION SUGGEST THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR LEARNING ADJECTIVES AS SUGGESTED IS PRESENT IN THE DOG. THE PROJECT INVOLVES TRAINING DOGS TO LINK NON-SENSE WORDS WITH PATCHES SHOWING SIZE AND LIGHT/DARK DIFFERENCES. THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE NEEDS TO HAVE DEMONSTRABLE EXPERIENCE IN BEHAVIOURAL TRAINING WITH DOGS.

SUMMER SCIENTIST IS AN ANNUAL EVENT THAT IS ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN'SLARGEST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN 2010AND IS CURRENTLY LEAD BY DR NIKO KARGAS. EACH YEAR, WE RUN A SUMMER SCIENTIST WEEK FOR CHILDREN AGED THREE TO TEN YEARS OLD. OUR EVENT OFFERS AN INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT WHERE CHILDREN COMING FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND HAVING DIFFERENT INTERESTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTAKE IN A VARIETY OF FUN ACTIVITIES AND RESEARCH STUDIES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LEARN ABOUT HUMAN DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOUR.
ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY WORK ALONGSIDE SELECTED SECOND-YEAR PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS ON DATA COLLECTION THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO WORK ON REAL AND CUTTING-EDGE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH THAT IS A STEP-UP FROM THEIR COURSE BASED STUDIES. THIS OFFERS STUDENTS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN DEDICATED EXPERIMENT BASE EXPERIENCE. THE FINDINGS OF THESE PROJECTS ARE USED TO INFORM REAL ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND ARE PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED ACADEMIC JOURNALS.
EACH YEAR WE WELCOME MORE AND MORE CHILDREN TO SUMMER SCIENTIST, INCLUDING MANY WHO HAVE ATTENDED THE EVENT IN PREVIOUS YEARS. FUTURE EVENTS WILL FEATURE MANY NEW ACADEMIC RESEARCH PROJECTS INVESTIGATING TOPICS SUCH AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTRUISM, LANGUAGE, MOTOR CONTROL, RISK BEHAVIOURS, SENSORY PERCEPTION, COGNITION, AND INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES.
RESEARCHERS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN HAVE TEAMED UP WITH THEWESC FOUNDATIONTO CREATE A NEW BROWSER-BASED GAME CALLED EYELANDER, WHICH AIMS TO HELP CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE WITH VISION-LOSS TO LEAD MORE INDEPENDENT LIVES.
THE GAME WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLEWITH VISUAL FIELD LOSS CAUSED BY CEREBRAL VISUAL IMPAIRMENT (CVI)  WHICH IS USUALLY THE RESULT OF A BRAIN INJURY  AND IT PROMPTS THE PLAYER TO USE THEIR VISION MOREEFFICIENTLY. THE GAME REQUIRES PLAYERS TO MOVE THEIR EYES QUICKLY AROUND THE SCREEN TOFIND MATCHING SHAPES AND COLOURS AT DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND IT IS PUNCTUATED WITH ENCOURAGING WORDS TO MOTIVATE THE PLAYER.
WHEN PLAYED REGULARLY THE GAME CAN IMPROVE PEOPLESPERFORMANCE OF EVERYDAY TASKS SUCH AS NAVIGATING THROUGH A CROWDED SPACE OR REACHING FOR ITEMS IN A SUPERMARKET.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT VISUAL SEARCH TRAINING CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY OF SIGHT FOLLOWING DAMAGE TO VISUAL CENTRES OF THE BRAIN IN ADULTS. THE PROBLEM IS THESE TRAINING PROGRAMMES ARE JUST TOO BORING TO USE WITH CHILDREN.OUR GAME WILL BE A FUN COMPUTER-BASED TOOL WHICH WILL BENEFIT CHILDREN WITH VISUAL FIELD LOSS-HOLES IN THEIR VISION DUE TO DAMAGE TO THE BRAINS VISUAL PATHWAYS.THIS IS AN EXCITING RESEARCH PROJECT WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER EXPERTISE FROM DIVERSE DISCIPLINES AND PUTS THIS KNOWLEDGE INTO PRACTICE IN A WAY THAT COULD MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN.
TRACY DE BERNHARDT DUNKIN, PRINCIPAL AND CEO AT THE WESC FOUNDATION, SAYS:

ALEXANDRIA  A HISTORIC EGYPTIAN CITY FOUNDED BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT AND ONCE CONSIDERED THE JEWEL OF THE MEDITERRANEAN  HAS FOR THE PAST HALF CENTURY BEEN FACING ONGOING DECAY.
A STRUGGLE BETWEEN ITS SYMBOLIC EURO-MEDITERRANEAN HERITAGE AND DISTINCTIVE SPIRIT OF PLACE AND CONFLICTING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL AGENDAS HAS RESULTED IN THE CRUMBLING OF ITS INSPIRING ARCHITECTURE AS WELL AS ITS VIBRANT CULTURE. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, A LEADING INTERNATIONAL ARCHITECT HAS BEEN DEDICATING HER WORK TO REVITALISING AND REGENERATING THE CITY SHE ONCE CALLED HOME.
STARTING WITH FOUAD STREET - THE MOST POTENT SYMBOL OF ALEXANDRIAS GRAND HISTORY, WITH ITS ELEGANT VILLAS AND ANTIQUE SHOPS  AT THE HEART OF THE CITYS HISTORIC DISTRICT, DR AMIRA ELNOKALYS WORK AIMS TO SYMPATHETICALLY REPURPOSE THE ANCIENT EGYPTIAN BUILDINGS FOR MODERN BUSINESS USE.
DR ELNOKALY, AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR IN SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, HAS BEEN WORKING WITH SIGMA PROPERTIES IN EGYPT FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS IN A BID TO RESTORE SOME OF ALEXANDRIAS MOST IMPRESSIVE BUILDINGS, REINVIGORATE ITS CULTURE, AND CREATE DYNAMIC NEW BUSINESS MODELS TO ENSURE THE CITY THRIVES INTO THE FUTURE.
TODAY, SOME OF THE OLDEST AND MOST IMPRESSIVE BUILDINGS IN ALEXANDRIA, ALTHOUGH LISTED, HAVE FALLEN INTO DISREPAIR OR WORSE, OR HAVE EVEN BEEN DEMOLISHED TO MAKE WAY FOR MODERN HOTELS. OUR WORK AIMS TO INJECT A SENSE OF LIFE BACK INTO THIS IMPORTANT AREA OF EGYPTIAN CULTURE, ENSURING THESE OLD BUILDINGS ARE REUSED SYMPATHETICALLY.
ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, LINCOLN SCHOOL OF ARCHITECTURE AND THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT
MANY OF THE ORIGINAL RETAIL SPACES LOCATED IN ALEXANDRIAS HISTORIC DISTRICT STRUGGLED TO ATTRACT ENOUGH BUSINESS AND SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED DOWN, WHILE RESIDENTIAL UNITS WERE ABANDONED OR RENTED AT VERY LOW PRICES, MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR OWNERS TO MAINTAIN THEIR BUILDINGS AND THEIR IMPRESSIVE HERITAGE FACADES, WITH VERY LITTLE OR NO SUPPORT FROM APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES. THESE FACTORS CAUSED A SERIOUS DECLINE IN REAL ESTATE VALUE IN ALEXANDRIAS CITY CENTRE, RENDERING INVESTMENT IN THE AREA UNFEASIBLE.
TO COMBAT THIS DECLINE, DR ELNOKALY BEGAN WORKING WITH SIGMA PROPERTIES TO DEVELOP FEASIBLE BUSINESS MODELS FOR REPURPOSED SPACES WITHIN THE HISTORIC BUILDINGS. THESE BUSINESSES ATTRACT A YOUNGER POPULATION BY OFFERING QUALITY SERVICES THAT ARE CAREFULLY INTEGRATED INTO HISTORIC SPACES, SUCH AS FOUAD STREETS IMPRESSIVE OPERA HALL, TO MAINTAIN THEIR ARCHITECTURAL VALUE AND ARTEFACT, WHILE INTRODUCING A DYNAMIC NEW CONCEPT WITHIN THEM.
AS PART OF THIS BID TO SAVE ALEXANDRIAS CULTURE, SIGMA PROPERTIES NOW OWNS AROUND HALF OF THE HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN THE FOUAD STREET AREA OF THE CITY. WHILE MANY OF THE PROPERTIES REMAIN VACANT UNTIL SUITABLE BUSINESS PLANS ARE DEVELOPED, TOGETHER WITH DR ELNOKALY THEY RUN WORKSHOPS FOR ARCHITECTURE STUDENTS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HIGHLIGHT THEIR OWN IMPORTANT WORK AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANCE AND POTENTIAL OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS.

ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANISATION, THERE WERE AN ESTIMATED 219 MILLION CASES OF MALARIA WORLDWIDE IN 2017 AND 435,000 DEATHS FROM THE DISEASE. NINE OUT OF TEN (93%) MALARIA DEATHS OCCURRED IN AFRICA AND MORE THAN HALF OF ALL DEATHS (61%) WERE CHILDREN UNDER FIVE.
NEW VACCINES OFFER HOPE FOR THE FUTURE, BUT IN THE MEANTIME ANTIMALARIAL DRUGS REMAIN THE FRONT-LINE MEDICAL INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, PREVENTION OF INFECTION BY ACTING AGAINST THE MOSQUITOES THROUGH BED-NETS AND INSECTICIDES IS A MAJOR ELEMENT IN THE FIGHT AGAINST MALARIA.
PROFESSOR CHRIS THOMAS, GLOBAL CHAIR IN WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, SPECIALISES IN MODELLING THE TRANSMISSION OF VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES LIKE MALARIA BY COMBINING FIELD ECOLOGY, REMOTE SENSING AND GEO-PHYSICAL MODELS WITH GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS, SPATIAL STATISTICAL AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMPUTING.
A FOCUS OF HIS CURRENT WORK EXPLORES NEW METHODS FOR PREDICTING THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF MOSQUITOES WHICH TRANSMIT MALARIA IN AFRICA, INCLUDING HOW THEIR SPREAD IS AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE.
HE IS THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR IN THE NERC-FUNDED FLOODMAL PROJECT, AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION DEPLOYING NOVEL TECHNIQUES TO STUDY MALARIA VECTOR DISTRIBUTION ON THE ZAMBEZI FLOODPLAIN, A VAST AREA WITH VERY HIGH LEVELS OF MALARIA TRANSMISSION IN WESTERN ZAMBIA. PROFESSOR MARK MACKLIN, DIRECTOR OF LINCOLNS CENTRE FOR WATER AND PLANETARY HEALTH, IS A CO-RESEARCHER ON THE PROJECT.
SINCE 2001 THERE HAVE BEEN HUGE REDUCTIONS IN MALARIA THROUGH THE GLOBAL MALARIA ELIMINATION PROGRAMME, EXPLAINS PROFESSOR THOMAS. BUT IN SOME AREAS SUCH AS WESTERN ZAMBIA PREVALENCE REMAINS VERY HIGH, WHEREAS IN OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE ALMOST ELIMINATED LOCAL TRANSMISSION, SUCH AS ZANZIBAR - WHERE WE ALSO HAVE A NEW RESEARCH PROGRAMME - MEDICAL SERVICES ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO SHIFT IN A LAST FEW ENTRENCHED AREAS. IT'S IN THESE CHALLENGING SITUATIONS WHERE WE THINK OUR APPROACH COULD MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE.
AFRICAN MALARIA MOSQUITOES BREED RAPIDLY IN OPEN, SHALLOW WATER LEFT BY RAINS, FLOODS, AND IRRIGATED FARMLAND. MALARIA IS OFTEN HIGHLY SEASONAL FOLLOWING THE RAINS AND WATER MOVEMENT ACROSS THE LAND, WITH MOSQUITO POPULATION DYNAMICS ALSO AFFECTED BY HUMIDITY AND TEMPERATURE. THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON DISEASE TRANSMISSION IS THEREFORE A MAJOR CONCERN FOR PROFESSOR THOMAS AND FELLOW SCIENTISTS. PART OF THE PUZZLE IS UNDERSTANDING HOW COMMUNITIES AND SERVICES CAN BEST ADAPT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHANGES.
NEW METHODS OF COMPUTER MODELLING USING HYDROLOGICAL AND HYDRAULIC MODELS OF WATER DISTRIBUTION AND FLOW COMBINED WITH HIGH RESOLUTION SATELLITE IMAGERY ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO PREDICT AND MAP, WEEKS IN ADVANCE, THE PRESENCE OF WATER BODIES WHERE MOSQUITOES BREED. THE HOPE IS THAT BY UNDERSTANDING WHERE WATER WILL BE IN RELATION TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN HOSTS, SCIENTISTS CAN PREDICT VARIATION IN THE RISK OF MALARIA IN FINE DETAIL ACROSS ENTIRE LANDSCAPES.
WE WANT TO HELP GUIDE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. IF WE CAN INFORM MEDICAL SERVICES WHERE TRANSMISSION HOTSPOTS ARE LIKELY TO ARISE IN ADVANCE, IT WILL ENABLE THEM TO RESPOND QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY ON THE GROUND WITH TARGETED PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES.
PROFESSOR THOMAS ADDED: WITH THE ANNUAL FLOODS ON THE ZAMBEZI BECOMING LESS PREDICTABLE DUE TO CLIMATE VARIABILITY, A MOBILE HUMAN POPULATION, AND SEVERAL SPECIES OF MOSQUITO VECTORS IMPLICATED IN TRANSMISSION, IT IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO PLAN INTERVENTIONS NEEDED TO ELIMINATE THE DISEASE. TO TACKLE THIS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE ZAMBIAN HEALTH SERVICE AND A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF RESEARCHERS FROM ZAMBIA, CANADA AND THE UK. WERE TRYING TO PREDICT TRANSMISSION LEVELS IN THIS VERY DYNAMIC LANDSCAPE USING OUR GEOGRAPHIC-ECOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES.
THE TEAM IS TAKING BIG DATA APPROACHES TO STUDYING DISEASE TRANSMISSION: NEW COMPUTING, BIOSCIENCES AND GEOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY ALLOWS THEM TO DO THINGS THAT WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. RAPIDLY GROWING INTERNET AND MOBILE NETWORKS IN AFRICA INCREASINGLY MEANS INFORMATION CAN NOW BE DISSEMINATED QUICKLY AND EASILY. HOWEVER, THEY STILL EMBARK ON MANY LONG 4X4 JOURNEYS AS WELL, TRAPPING MOSQUITOS OVERNIGHT IN REMOTE VILLAGES AND WADING IN SWAMPS TO SAMPLE LARVAE!
THEIR INTERDISCIPLINARY WORK IS HAVING A DELIVERING VALUABLE INSIGHTS AND HAVING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX ISSUE OF MAPPING AND PREDICTING THE SPREAD OF MALARIA.

THIS WILL INVOLVE INTERVIEWS WITH MPS, PEERS, CLERKS AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS.", 'DR BOCHEL SAID: "PARLIAMENT IS KEEN TO ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS, AND PEOPLE CAN NOW DO THIS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH PARLIAMENT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE PROCESS IS AS POSITIVE AS POSSIBLE."
IN A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM PEOPLE MAY NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY ASK FOR, SO THEIR TREATMENT BY THE SYSTEM AND EXPERIENCE OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT; FINAL DECISIONS ARE MADE BY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, SO THE PUBLIC MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT.

HOW DIGITAL HUBS CAN BRIDGE THE URBAN-RURAL DIVIDE | CASE STUDIES | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNBRIDGING THE URBAN-RURAL DIVIDE
DIGITAL HUBS ARE PHYSICAL SPACES WITH ACCESS TO SUPERFAST BROADBAND, ALONGSIDE OTHER COMMUNITY AND BUSINESS FOCUSSED SERVICES  FROM PROVIDING MEETING AND NETWORKING SPACE TO OFFERING OPPORTUNITIES TO TEST NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE PROJECT HAS MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE IN LINCOLNSHIRE, WHERE ONLY TWO PER CENT OF PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN DIGITAL JOBS IN BOTH THE DIGITAL AND NON-DIGITAL SECTORS, WHICH IS HALF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
THE GUIDELINES ARE PRODUCED BY THE LINCOLN TEAM WHO MAKE UP PART OF CORA (CONNECTING REMOTE AREAS WITH DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES)  AN INTERNATIONAL PROJECT BRINGING TOGETHER A CONSORTIUM OF 18 ORGANISATIONS FROM SEVEN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BORDERING THE NORTH SEA. PART-FUNDED BY THE EUROPEAN UNIONS INTERREG NORTH SEA REGION PROGRAMME, CORA IS DEDICATED TO STIMULATING DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, SERVICES, AND SKILLS IN RURAL AREAS TO MAKE THEM MORE ATTRACTIVE TO BUSINESS AND FAMILIES.
"OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT DIGITAL HUBS ARE POTENTIAL DRIVERS FOR POSITIVE CHANGE AND CAN BE A STARTING POINT TO OVERCOME THESE DIGITAL DIVIDE CHALLENGES," SAYS LIZ PRICE, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW. "THAT IS WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE MORE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO INVEST IN THESE HUBS, AND MORE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES TO ACCESS THEIR FACILITIES."
DIGITAL HUBS REALLY COULD HELP PEOPLE FROM RURAL AREAS TO FEEL MUCH LESS ISOLATED AND BETTER CONNECTED. THEY CAN TRANSFORM THE WAY RURAL COMMUNITIES LIVE AND WORK.
THE TEAM FOUND THAT RURAL BUSINESSES HAVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING APPROPRIATE EXTERNAL IT TRAINING, TROUBLE RECRUITING PEOPLE WITH APPROPRIATE DIGITAL SKILLS, AND THE EXISTING WORKFORCE OFTEN LACKS SUFFICIENT DIGITAL SKILLS. THEY ALSO CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH STUDY OF SEVERAL EXISTING DIGITAL HUBS LOCATED ACROSS EUROPE AND ANALYSED THE BENEFITS THEY BRING TO THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THE NEW GUIDE DETAILS THE LOGISTICS AND BENEFITS OF ESTABLISHING A NEW HUB AND CAN BE ACCESSEDONLINE.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SPECIALISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN HAVE PRODUCED A COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE ON HOW TO SET UP AND RUN HIGH-TECH DIGITAL HUBS IN REMOTE AND RURAL LOCATIONS WHICH SUFFER FROM A LACK OF DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE.

THE REVERSE COAL PROJECT
LED BY A TEAM FROM THE LAPWING ESTATE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, THE REVERSE COAL PROJECT SERVES AS A CRUCIAL STEPPING STONE TOWARDS A SCALABLE AND SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. IT DEMONSTRATES THE POTENTIAL OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES, PAVING THE WAY FOR BROADER ADOPTION AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON A GLOBAL SCALE.
THE GLOBAL FOOD SYSTEM IS RESPONSIBLE NOT ONLY FOR 30 PER CENT OF CO2 EMISSIONS BUT ALSO 60 PER CENT OF NATURE LOSS, SO A RADICAL TRANSFORMATION IS NEEDED. THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REVERSE THE IMPACT OF COAL VIA AN ENGINEERED NATURAL SOLUTION TO EXTRACT CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND RETURN IT BACK INTO THE GEOLOGICAL RESERVE FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE.
"REVERSE COAL SEQUESTERS CARBON AND PRODUCES FOOD WITH POSITIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT," EXPLAINS DR AMIR BADIEE, WHO ALONG WITH PROFESSOR SIMON PEARSON FROM LIAT, IS LEADING THE PROJECT.
"FOSSIL FUELS HAVE BEEN USED FOR SO LONG IN FOOD PRODUCTION THAT THEIR NEGATIVE IMPACT CAN NOT BE UNDERSTATED, BUT THIS PROJECT PROVES THAT THERE IS A BETTER WAY. IT SOLVES THE INHERENT DILEMMA OF BIOENERGY CROPS: THE LOSS OF LAND FROM FOOD PRODUCTION."

TACKLING THE GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS
LEARNING LESSONS FROM THE PAST
THERE IS MORE FOOD BEING PRODUCED GLOBALLY THAN EVER BEFORE AND YET MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD STILL FACE MALNUTRITION. EVENTS SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND RUSSIAS INVASION OF UKRAINE HAVE EXPOSED SIGNIFICANT VULNERABILITIES IN THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY SYSTEM, ACCELERATING THE NEED FOR INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO LONG-TERM FOOD SECURITY.
TO TACKLE GLOBAL FOOD CRISES AND HELP SECURE THE FUTURE OF FOOD, THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANISATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS (FAO) AND THE BRUSSELS INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDIES (BRIAS) HAVE ESTABLISHED AN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION DRAWING ON EXPERTISE FROM AROUND THE WORLD TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF HUNGER AND FOOD SECURITY.
AN ACADEMIC FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS AMONG THE INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC SPECIALISTS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS EFFORT. DR MATTHEW HANNAFORD, SENIOR LECTURER IN HUMAN GEOGRAPHY, WAS INVITED TO BRUSSELS TO PRESENT HIS RESEARCH AT THE INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP JOINTLY HOSTED BY FAO AND BRIAS ENTITLED RE-IMAGINING AGRI-FOOD SYSTEM TRANSFORMATIONS: ENLARGING AND ENRICHING TIME HORIZONS.
IN AN ORIGINAL APPROACH, FOCUS WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS LESSONS FROM HISTORY TO EVALUATE THE SUCCESSES AND FAILURES OF PREVIOUS INTERVENTIONS UNDER CERTAIN SOCIETAL AND AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS. THIS KNOWLEDGE CAN INFORM THE WORK OF FORESIGHT PLANNERS IN BUILDING SCENARIOS TOWARD FOOD SUSTAINABILITY AMIDST UNCERTAINTY.
HISTORIANS HAVE LONG BEEN WRITING ABOUT FOOD INSECURITY AND MANY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF FOOD CRISES IN RECENT CENTURIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY HUMAN MADE. YET IT IS RARE THAT DEEP HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF PAST INTERVENTIONS IN FOOD SYSTEMS INFORMS FORESIGHT PLANNING TO HELP AVOID REPEATING THE MISTAKES AND INJUSTICES OF THE PAST.
DR HANNAFORD EXPLAINS THAT WHILE FOOD PRODUCTION OUTPUT ALREADY SURPASSES NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND IS CONTINUING TO RISE, POPULATION GROWTH, DIET CHANGES, ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION, NATURAL RESOURCE SCARCITY, MILITARY CONFLICTS, AND CLIMATE CHANGE COULD THREATEN PEOPLES ACCESS TO FOOD IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD.
"AFTER A PERIOD OF GREAT OPTIMISM, FOOD CRISES ARE ONCE AGAIN ON THE RISE," HE SAYS. "INDEED, IN MANY COUNTRIES PROGRESS ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL OF ZERO HUNGER, IS DETERIORATING.
WE CAN BEGIN TO REMEDY PROBLEMS BY BRINGING HISTORIANS AND FORESIGHT PLANNERS TOGETHER IN THE SAME ROOM, WHICH IS WHAT BRIAS FACILITATED.

TRANSFORMING THE LIVES OF YOUNG FATHERS | RESEARCH FEATURES | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNRESEARCH SPOTLIGHT
THERE IS A COMMONLY HELD VIEW THAT FATHERS BELOW THE AGE OF 25 ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, UNCARING, OR IRRESPONSIBLE. THIS CAN SOMETIMES LEAD TO YOUNG FATHERS EXPERIENCING EXCLUSION AND STIGMATISATION IN SOCIETY. 
A RESEARCH PROJECT LED BY ANNA TARRANT, PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, IS QUESTIONING THESE POPULAR MYTHS, COLLATING EVIDENCE THAT YOUNG DADS NOT ONLY HAVE A DESIRE TO BE POSITIVELY INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILDRENS LIVES, BUT THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO ADVOCATE FOR POLICY CHANGE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL TO INTRODUCE MORE FATHER-INCLUSIVE PRACTICES.

THE 'FOLLOWING YOUNG FATHERS FURTHER' PROJECT WAS ONE OF JUST THREE HIGHLY COMMENDED ENTRIES IN THE CATEGORY OF RESEARCH AND INNOVATION AT THE RECENT UK RESEARCH AND INNOVATION FUTURE LEADERS FELLOWSHIPS IMPACT AWARDS.
S RESEARCH REVEALS THAT YOUNG FATHERS ARE THE MOST MARGINALISED OF PARENTS, WITH SUPPORT SERVICES IN HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, AND THE STATUTORY AND VOLUNTARY SECTORS NOT TYPICALLY TARGETING THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC. HOWEVER, FOLLOWING ATTENDANCE AT A YDC WORKSHOP, PROFESSIONALS ARE GAINING AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF YOUNG FATHERS COMMITMENTS TO THEIR CHILDREN AND WHAT GOOD PRACTICE ENTAILS.", 'OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH YOUNG FATHERS AS EXPERTS BY EXPERIENCE IN AREAS LIKE LEEDS, GRIMSBY AND THE NORTH EAST, MORE RECENTLY, IS PROVING JUST HOW INVESTED YOUNG FATHERS ARE IN SUPPORTING THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES," EXPLAINS PROFESSOR TARRANT. "THIS APPROACH IS EMPOWERING FOR YOUNG FATHERS, THEIR FAMILIES, AND PROFESSIONALS.

YDC DELIVERS INNOVATIVE TRAINING ON INTEGRATING FATHER-INCLUSIVE PRACTICES TO HUNDREDS OF PROFESSIONALS ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, AND SOME YOUNG FATHERS WERE SUPPORTED FURTHER TO PARTICIPATE IN NATIONAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS AT THE ALL PARTY PARLIAMENTARY GROUP ON FATHERHOOD.
IN ADDITION TO CAMPAIGNING FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE IMPROVEMENTS, THE YDC PROVIDES YOUNG DADS WITH AN INVALUABLE PLATFORM TO CONNECT SOCIALLY AND DEVELOP CONFIDENCE, GRANTING THEM WIDER BENEFITS FOR THEIR CITIZENSHIP. FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE NONE OF THE FATHERS WERE IN PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT BEFORE THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE TRAINING, SEVERAL SECURED PAID WORK AND/OR TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES BY BEING ABLE TO EVIDENCE THEIR NEWLY ACQUIRED SKILLS.
THE TEAM HAS ALSO SUPPORTED THE CO-CREATION OF DIGIDAD THAT FURTHER SEEKS TO DEVELOP THE SKILLSET OF YOUNG FATHERS.

AS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF OUR TIME, CLIMATE CHANGE HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT RISES IN SEA LEVELS, AND THE ACCURATE PREDICTION OF JUST HOW MUCH THEY WILL RISE IN FUTURE IS SUBJECT TO ONGOING ANALYSIS.
NOW, A NEW STUDY INVOLVING AN INTERNATIONAL GROUP OF 29 ICE-SHEET EXPERTS, LED BY EDWARD HANNA, PROFESSOR OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AND METEOROLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, HAS IDENTIFIED THAT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED RISES IN SEA LEVEL COULD BE BETTER PREDICTED BY GAINING A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ANTARCTIC AND GREENLAND ICE SHEETS.
THE TEAM OF INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENTISTS UNDERTOOK A REVIEW OF EVIDENCE GAINED FROM OBSERVATIONAL DATA, GEOLOGICAL RECORDS, AND COMPUTER MODEL SIMULATIONS. PUBLISHED IN THE NATURE JOURNAL, NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT, THE RESEARCH DISCUSSES THE DEMAND TO MONITOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM TIMESCALES OF CHANGES IN ICE SHEET BEHAVIOUR, TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY IN FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE PROJECTIONS.
THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW - THIS RESEARCH COULD HELP TO PREVENT FUTURE ICE-SHEET MASS LOSS AND IMPROVE PROJECTIONS, HELPING US PAVE THE WAY FOR A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.
THE NEW STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT PREDICTIONS OF SEA LEVEL RISE COULD BE REFINED, TO BETTER PREPARE FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. GLACIAL MASSES ARE SUBJECT TO SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS AND EXTREME EVENTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF TIMESCALES, FROM DAYS TO THOUSANDS OF YEARS, AND AS A RESULT DIVERSE KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE GATHERED.
HISTORICALLY, ICE SHEETS HAVE BEEN THOUGHT OF AS SLOW-MOVING AND DELAYED IN THEIR RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THESE ICE SHEETS LOCK UP SEA WATER, EQUIVALENT TO AN INCREASE OF 65 METRES OF GLOBAL SEA LEVEL RISE. IN CONTRAST, THE TEAMS RESEARCH ILLUSTRATES THAT THESE HUGE GLACIERS RESPOND IN FAR QUICKER AND UNEXPECTED WAYS AS THE CLIMATE WARMS, SIMILARLY TO THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF HURRICANES AND HEATWAVES RESPONDING TO CHANGES WITH THE CLIMATE.
GROUND AND SATELLITE OBSERVATIONS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLIMATE MODELS DEMONSTRATE THAT SUDDEN HEATWAVES AND LARGE STORMS CAN HAVE LONG-LASTING EFFECTS ON ICE SHEETS. THIS WEATHER FLUCTUATION CAN LEAD TO EXTREME MELT EVENTS, SUCH AS THE GREENLAND ICE SHEET MELT IN JULY 2023, OR CAUSE ICE SHELVES TO DISAPPEAR ALMOST OVERNIGHT, AS WITH THE ANTARCTICA CONGER ICE SHELF COLLAPSE IN 2022.
ICE-SHEET MASS LOSS IS NOT A SIMPLE UNIFORM RESPONSE TO CLIMATE WARMING BUT IS PUNCTUATED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY SHORT-TERM EXTREME MELTING EVENTS, AND BY THE CATASTROPHIC BREAK-UP OF ICE SHELVES ALONG THE COAST WHICH CAN OCCUR RAPIDLY UNPLUGGING MUCH LARGER AMOUNTS OF ICE FROM FURTHER INLAND," COMMENTED EDWARD HANNA, PROFESSOR OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AND METEOROLOGY.
THE PATTERNS, PROCESSES, AND IMPACTS OF ICE-SHEET VARIABILITY ON DIFFERENT TIMESCALES FROM DAYS THROUGH TO MILLENNIA ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR SUCH VARIABILITY CAN RESULT IN BIASED PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE ICE-SHEET MASS LOSS.
THIS REVIEW SERVES AS A CALL TO ACTION, URGING THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TO PRIORITISE RESEARCH EFFORTS THAT WILL ENHANCE THE UNDERSTANDING OF ICE SHEET VARIABILITY. IT IS CRUCIAL THAT SCIENTISTS, POLICYMAKERS, AND STAKEHOLDERS COLLABORATE MORE CLOSELY TO IMPROVE CLIMATE AND OCEAN MONITORING SYSTEMS, REFINE MODELS, AND ENSURE THAT ICE SHEET MODELS ACCURATELY REPRESENT THE OBSERVED CHANGES.

COULD THE UNRELIABLE BRITISH SUMMER SOON BE A THING OF THE PAST?
ACCURATE SEASONAL WEATHER FORECASTS ARE A VITAL TOOL NOT JUST FOR HOLIDAYMAKERS, THEY ALSO HAVE GREAT IMPACT ON A RANGE OF SECTORS, FROM SHAPING PUBLIC SAFETY POLICIES SUCH AS FLOOD PREVENTION STRATEGIES, TO HELPING THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MITIGATE LOW CROP YIELDS WHICH WOULD INCREASE PRICES FOR CONSUMERS.
RESEARCH LED BY EDWARD HANNA, PROFESSOR OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AND METEOROLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, HAS DEVELOPED A NEW METHOD USING AI AND MACHINE LEARNING WHICH COULD IMPROVE PREDICTING SEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE UK AND NORTHWEST EUROPE.
THE NARMAX MODEL OFFERS A POWERFUL TOOL IN THE QUEST TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION AS WELL AS MAKING MORE ACCURATE SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTIONS. IT COULD ALSO BENEFIT MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING AGRI-FOOD, ENERGY, LEISURE, AND TOURISM INDUSTRIES.
OUR PUBLISHED PAPERS DEMONSTRATE GREAT POTENTIAL FOR NARMAX MODELLING TO PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN HELPING TO REFINE THE NEXT GENERATION OF SUPERCOMPUTER FORECASTING MODELS, WHICH HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY COMPUTATIONALLY HUNGRY, AND IN ENHANCING SEASONAL FORECASTS.
TO PREDICT SEASONAL WEATHER OVER NORTHWEST EUROPE, MAJOR WEATHER FORECASTING CENTRES CURRENTLY RELY ON EXPENSIVE SUPERCOMPUTER MODELS. TO SUPPLEMENT THESE CONVENTIONAL METHODS, THE GROUP USED AN AI AND MACHINE LEARNING METHOD KNOWN AS NARMAX (NONLINEAR AUTOREGRESSIVE MOVING AVERAGE MODELS WITH EXOGENOUS INPUTS) TO PREDICT THE STATE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC JET STREAM AND ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION, BOTH STRONGLY LINKED TO SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION ANOMALIES.
NARMAX HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN MANY OTHER FIELDS OF RESEARCH AND IN THIS CASE, EARLY PREDICTIONS WERE MADE FOR BOTH SUMMER AND WINTER, FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT AIR CIRCULATION PATTERNS WHICH COMMONLY AFFECT THE NORTH ATLANTIC REGION AND SUBSEQUENT NORTHWEST EUROPEAN SEASONAL WEATHER.
THE STUDY RESULTS SHOWED HIGH ACCURACY FOR BOTH SEASONS, AND ALL THREE CIRCULATION PATTERNS EXAMINED. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE CONVENTIONAL AND MORE EXPENSIVE SUPERCOMPUTER MODELS STRUGGLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT SEASONAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS OVER THIS AREA IN SUMMER, TENDING TO UNDERESTIMATE YEAR-TO-YEAR VARIATIONS FOR BOTH SEASONS.
IN ADDITION, THE NARMAX METHOD HAS BEEN USED TO ANALYSE POSSIBLE CAUSES OF ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION CHANGES. THIS INFORMATION COULD BE USED FOR INTERPRETATION AND TO HELP IMPROVE THE SUPERCOMPUTER MODEL OUTPUTS.
"THIS BREAKTHROUGH HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS THAT COULD PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN IMPROVING SEASONAL FORECASTING, AS WELL AS INFORMING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE WEATHER FORECASTING MODELS, PARTICULARLY DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS," EXPLAINS EDWARD HANNA, PROFESSOR OF CLIMATE SCIENCE AND METEOROLOGY.
THIS IS AN EXCITING PROJECT THAT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER DIVERSE DISCIPLINES AND EXPERTS IN METEOROLOGICAL SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING WITH THE AIMS OF IMPROVING SEASONAL WEATHER PREDICTION AND APPLYING THE RESULTS TO END USERS."

IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
MANY PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH PROBATION WILL EXPERIENCE MORE THAN ONE HEALTH PROBLEM AT ANY GIVEN TIME AND OFTEN EXPERIENCE OTHER NEGATIVE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH SUCH AS UNEMPLOYMENT AND HOMELESSNESS. VERY LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE ON THIS POPULATION AND THEIR VOICE IS SELDOM HEARD BY THOSE COMMISSIONING HEALTHCARE OR THOSE PROVIDING OVERSIGHT AND SCRUTINY OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES.
FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE SEE BELOW, OR VISIT THE TOOLKIT WEBSITE.
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
DESPITE THE HIGH LEVEL AND COMPLEXITY OF HEALTH NEEDS IN THIS GROUP, PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH PROBATION FACE BOTH SYSTEM-LEVEL AND PERSONAL-LEVEL BARRIERS TO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE. MANY PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH PROBATION ARE NOT REGISTERED WITH A GP, AND/OR ONLY ACCESS HEALTHCARE DURING CRISES (REVOLVING DOORS AGENCY 2013). SOMETIMES SERVICES SIMPLY DO NOT EXIST TO MEET THEIR NEEDS, AND SOMETIMES SERVICES ARE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS DUE TO THINGS LIKE THEIR LOCATION, OPENING HOURS, RESTRICTIVE REFERRAL CRITERIA AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD ACCESS ROUTES. MOREOVER, THE HEALTH NEEDS OF PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH PROBATION AND HOW BEST TO STRUCTURE SERVICE PROVISION TO MAKE HEALTHCARE ACCESSIBLE TO AND APPROPRIATE FOR THIS GROUP ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSIDERED BY HEALTHCARE COMMISSIONERS.
WE HOPE THAT THIS TOOLKIT WILL ASSIST THOSE WORKING IN HEALTH AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ENVIRONMENTS IN ENGLAND, AND IN PARTICULAR COMMISSIONERS TO IMPROVE THE WAY IN WHICH HEALTHCARE IS PROVIDED FOR PEOPLE IN CONTACT WITH PROBATION.

IVOIRE, MALI AND SENEGAL. HIVST WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE EXISTING TESTING POLICIES, PROGRAMMES AND ACTIVITIES. ATLAS HIVST DISTRIBUTION WAS ORGANISED THROUGH FACILITY-BASED CHANNELS (DELIVERY OF HIVST KITS THROUGH PUBLIC OR COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH FACILITIES), AND COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACHES INVOLVING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES ENGAGING: FEMALE SEX WORKERS , MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN, AND PERSONS WHO INJECT DRUGS . PEER EDUCATORS CONDUCTED THESE OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THROUGH GROUP AND FACE-TO-FACE ACTIVITIES. OUTREACH ACTIVITIES REPRESENTED THE MAJORITY (~85%) OF ATLASS DISTRIBUTION VOLUME. ATLAS ACTIVITIES RELIED BOTH ON PRIMARY DISTRIBUTION  HIVST KITS WERE DISTRIBUTED BY PEER EDUCATORS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO PRIMARY CONTACTS FOR THEIR PERSONAL USE  AND SECONDARY DISTRIBUTION. WITH SECONDARY DISTRIBUTION, PRIMARY CONTACTS WERE INVITED TO REDISTRIBUTE SOME HIVST KITS TO THEIR PEERS, SEXUAL PARTNERS, AND CLIENTS. THESE SECONDARY CONTACTS WERE OFTEN MEMBERS OF KEY POPULATIONS THAT CAN BE MORE DIFFICULT TO ENGAGE IN HIV PREVENTION, ALONG WITH OTHER PERIPHERAL VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. SEVERAL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND SURVEYS (QUANTITATIVE, QUALITATIVE, COSTING, MODELLING) HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED WITHIN ATLAS. THIS COMMUNICATION WILL PRESENT A SYNTHESIS OF THE MAIN FINDINGS.", '
WHERE WE CURRENTLY FIND OURSELVES IN THE WORLD OF DISEASE SURVEILLANCE HAS BEEN INFORMED BY MANY TOP-DOWN TARGETS AND FRAMEWORKS. DEVELOPING GLOBAL TARGETS AND INDICATORS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO MOST SETTINGS AND SET AT THE CORRECT LEVEL OF RESOLUTION TO INFORM ACTION, IS CHALLENGING. FOCUSING ON THE UNAIDS TREATMENT FOR ALL TARGETS AND GLOBAL AIDS MONITORING INDICATORS, AND UTILISING DATA FROM THE UK AND SOUTHERN AFRICA, I WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE OUR USE OF ROUTINELY COLLECTED HEALTH DATA TO MONITOR AND INFORM OUR RESPONSE.
DISEASES ARE INHERENTLY SPATIALLY VARIABLE, AFFECTING POPULATIONS IN DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT WAYS. UNDERSTANDING AND PREDICTING THIS VARIATION IN SPACE AND TIME OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TARGET LIMITED RESOURCES TO THOSE WHO NEED IT, MAXIMISING IMPACT OF INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, DISEASE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY LACK THE EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY TO ANALYSE SPATIAL DATA IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. THIS PRESENTS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY. WITH A FOCUS ON TROPICAL DISEASES SUCH AS MALARIA AND LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS, HUGH WILL PRESENT EXAMPLES OF HOW MACHINE LEARNING, SPATIAL STATISTICS AND TECHNOLOGY CAN BE COMBINED AND MADE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO HELP TARGET AND TRACK INTERVENTIONS.

THE SHORE STUDY IS A COLLABORATIVE CASE STUDY BETWEEN THE HEALTH PROTECTION RESEARCH UNIT (HPRU) AND THE NATIONAL SURVEYS OF SEXUAL ATTITUDES AND LIFESTYLES (NATSAL) BASED AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON (UCL) IT IS LED FROM LIIRH BY DR HELEN MARKHAM-JONES.
SEXUAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN YET POSITIVE OUTCOMES ACROSS POPULATIONS AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS VARY, AND AS SUCH SEXUAL WELLBEING PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY. THE SHORE STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE SEXUAL HEALTH AND DISEASE DETERMINANTS IN ONE OF THE MOST DEPRIVED AREAS OF ENGLAND, A COASTAL RESORT IN RURAL LINCOLNSHIRE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN AN AREA DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPERIENCING POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND SOCIAL DEPRIVATION. SHORE RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING A BROAD RESEARCH PROGRAMME TO UNDERSTAND THE HIGHLY COMPLEX DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH LINKED TO SEXUALITY-IN-SPACE IN A REMOTE COASTAL COMMUNITY. SEXUAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN YET POSITIVE OUTCOMES ACROSS POPULATIONS AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS VARY, AND AS SUCH SEXUAL WELLBEING PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH EQUITY.
DESPITE URGENT CALLS TO ADDRESS THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, LOWER LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND HIGH RATES OF PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT COASTAL RESIDENTS LIVING IN MOBILE OR TEMPORARY HOUSING (E.G., CARAVANS AND PARK HOMES). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY LED BY LIIRH DIRECTOR PROFESSOR MARK GUSSY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EXTENT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN MOBILE OR TEMPORARY HOUSING ON ENGLANDS EAST COAST. FOR THIS RESEARCH DATA WERE FROM TWO MAIN SOURCES; THE UK OFFICE FOR NATIONAL STATISTICS (ONS) AND THE CONSUMER DATA RESEARCH CENTRE (CDRC), THE UNITED KINGDOMS LEADING CONSUMER DATA SOURCE.
THIS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED THAT THOSE LIVING IN MOBILE OR TEMPORARY HOUSING ALONG ENGLANDS EAST COAST TEND TO LIVE IN AREAS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF DEPRIVATION AND HAVE LOW INCOME, LACK OF EDUCATION AND SKILLS ATTAINMENT, AND LIMITED EMPLOYMENT. THESE FACTORS ARE KEY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR HEALTH AND WELLBEING. THE STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INSIGHTS ON HOW PLACE, GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS CONVERGE ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING OUTCOMES.
IN CONCLUSION WE FOUND THAT THE IDYLLIC BEAUTY OF ENGLANDS COASTAL AREAS CAN MASK SOME OF THE WORST HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. COASTAL COMMUNITIES MAY BE VALUED FOR THEIR NATURAL AND SCIENTIFIC IMPORTANCE, BUT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE ACTION, POOR HEALTH AND WELLBEING OUTCOMES WILL CONTINUE. THE LIIRH ARE NOW DEVELOPING THIS WORK FURTHER BY WORKING WITH COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND CARAVAN PARK RESIDENTS TO TRANSFORM THESE FINDINGS INTO ACCESSIBLE SUMMARIES AS WELL AS, CO-DESIGNING HEALTH-PROMOTION MATERIALS.
UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF DISTANCE AND DISADVANTAGE ON LUNG CANCER CARE AND OUTCOMES
THERE ARE WIDE VARIATIONS AND STARK INEQUALITIES IN LUNG CANCER CARE AND SURVIVAL ACROSS THE UK. MOST WORK TO DATE HAS FOCUSSED ON IMPROVING CLINICAL SERVICES AND MUCH LESS ON THE FACTORS AFFECTING PATIENTS ACCESS TO TREATMENT. THIS PLACE-BASED STUDY LED BY LIIRH INVESTIGATORS DR DAVID NELSON AND DR SAM COOKE IN COLLABORATION WITH COLLEAGUES FROM QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON AND FUNDED BY CANCER RESEARCH UK AND WILL EXPLORE AND CHARACTERISE HOW PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND DISTANCE FROM THE LOCATION OF SPECIALIST SERVICES INTERSECT AND IMPACT ON ACCESS TO OPTIMAL LUNG CANCER CARE AND THEREFORE ON OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER.
IN-DEPTH, SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WILL BE CARRIED OUT WITH PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER DIAGNOSED WITHIN THE PRIOR THREE MONTHS AND THEIR INFORMAL CARERS, WHO LIVE IN AN URBAN (NORTHEAST LONDON) OR RURAL (LINCOLNSHIRE) SETTING.
A FRAMEWORK APPROACH TO THEMATIC ANALYSIS WILL BE APPLIED TO INITIALLY EXPLORE HOW PATIENT AND CARER CHARACTERISTICS, AND FACTORS RELATED TO THEIR LOCATION RELATIVE TO SPECIALIST LUNG CANCER SERVICES, INTERACT TO INFLUENCE PATIENTS CAPABILITY, OPPORTUNITY, AND MOTIVATION TO ENGAGE WITH THE OPTIMAL LUNG CANCER CARE PATHWAY. SUBSEQUENTLY WE WILL COMPARE AND CONTRAST THESE FACTORS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN SETTINGS.
THE FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP A PATIENT-CENTRED ENGAGEMENT INTERVENTION WHICH ENSURES THAT LUNG CANCER SERVICES AND SUPPORT ARE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF LOCAL PEOPLE IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. THIS INTERVENTION WILL BE CO-DESIGNED WITH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PEOPLE LIVING WITH AND AFFECTED BY LUNG CANCER.
DESPITE THE FREQUENCY OF MENTAL HEALTH PRESENTATIONS, PRE-HOSPITAL CLINICIANS HAVE PERCEIVED THEY LACK EXPERTISE AND CONFIDENCE MANAGING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. FURTHERMORE, THEY FACE PARTICULAR PERSONAL, ORGANIZATION AND ETHICAL CHALLENGES WITH THIS GROUP OF PATIENTS AND THAT INCREASING KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, TREATMENT OPTIONS AND PATHWAYS WOULD ENHANCE THE CARE PROVIDED. EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN URBAN AREAS HAVE SHORTER PRE-HOSPITAL, RESPONSE, ON-SCENE AND TRANSPORT TIMES WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE IN RURAL AREAS.

THERE IS A LACK OF LITERATURE REVIEW STUDIES OF PARAMEDIC AND AMBULANCE CLINICIAN DELIVERED INTERVENTIONS FOR MANAGING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS DESPITE THESE BEING A COMMON AND IMPORTANT PRESENTATION TO EMERGENCY MEDICAL (AMBULANCE) SERVICES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW LED FROM LIIRH BY DR DAVID NELSON, IN COLLABORATION WITH COLLEAGUES FROM THE CAHRU AND DIRE TEAMS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN, IS ON INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PRESENTATIONS TO AMBULANCE SERVICES IN URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS.
THE RURAL AND COASTAL HEALTH RESEARCH TOOLKIT
THIS TOOLKIT DEVELOPED BY LIIRH RESEARCHER DR HAYDEN BIRD AND FUNDED BY NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH RESEARCH EAST MIDLANDS CLINICAL RESEARCH NETWORK HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS GUIDANCE FOR RESEARCHING HEALTH AND CARE IN RURAL AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES. EMERGING FROM A TOOLKIT ON BAME POPULATIONS DEVELOPED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER, LIIRH HAVE UNDERTAKEN EVIDENCE REVIEWS, STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, AND INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS TO CREATE A SERIES OF CORE GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCHERS. THE TOOLKIT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN OCTOBER AND AVAILABLE TO BE USED BY THE NIHR, FUNDING APPLICANTS, RESEARCHERS, PRACTITIONERS, AND STUDENTS.
THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS RESPONSIVE STUDIES TEAM
LIIRH ARE PARTNERING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM AND LOUGHBOROUGH UNIVERSITY IN THE PHIRST-LIGHT TEAM. PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION RESPONSIVE STUDIES TEAMS PROVIDE TIMELY AND ACCESSIBLE EVALUATIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS BEING DELIVERED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT ORGANISATIONS ACROSS THE UK. THE GOAL OF PHIRST IS TO HELP BUILD A KNOWLEDGE BASE TO SHARE LEARNING AND INFORM DECISIONS AROUND FUTURE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. PHIRST IS FUNDED BY NIHR PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH PROGRAMME. THIS PROJECT IS LED FROM LIIRH BY PROFESSOR MARK GUSSY.
THE LIIRH TEAM HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF HIV RESEARCH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON HIV EPIDEMIOLOGY AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO HIV TESTING AND PREVENTION. LIIRH RESEARCHERS, DR PAUL MEE AND DR MAXIME INGHELS ARE KEY INVESTIGATORS IN TWO 1.7M INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH PROJECTS FUNDED BY THE US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH). AT THE HEART OFU202FTHE HARNESSING MALE PEER NETWORKS TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT WITH HIV PREVENTION" (IMPERATIVE) TRIAL, LIES THE PROMOTION OF PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PREP) AS A HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR PREVENTING HIV INFECTION. IN THIS STUDY WHICH WILL BE CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MANICALAND CENTRE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH IN ZIMBABWE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS FROM AFRICA, THE UNITED KINGDOM, DENMARK, GERMANY AND THE USA, THE TEAM OF RESEARCHERS WILL SEEK TO ESTABLISH THE POPULATION IMPACT OF HIV SELF-TEST DISTRIBUTION THROUGH MALE SOCIAL NETWORKS, COUPLED WITH INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY-BASED SUPPORT ON PREP UPTAKE.U202F ZIMBABWE, LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, FACES THE HARSH REALITY OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC. WITH A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE POPULATION AFFECTED BY THE VIRUS, INNOVATIVE APPROACHES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO COMBAT ITS DEVASTATING IMPACT.U202F THE RESEARCH FINDINGS HOLD PROMISE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A GENERALISABLE, MULTICOMPONENT MALE PEER-BASED HIV SELF-TESTING AND PREP UPTAKE MODEL THAT COULD BE APPLIED IN OTHER HIGH HIV INCIDENCE SETTINGS, BRINGING HOPE FOR PROGRESS IN THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST HIV.
FINDINGS FROM THE SECOND PROJECT THE CHANGING FACE OF HIV IN THE ERA OF COVID-19: MAXIMISING HIV INCIDENCE REDUCTION THROUGH DYNAMIC TARGETING OF CURRENT AND FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS OF ACQUISITION RISK", WILL BE USED TO INFORM THE FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMMES. ALTHOUGH RECENT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THERE HAS BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN NEW HIV INFECTIONS IN RURAL AREAS IN SUBSAHARAN AFRICA, EVENTS SUCH AS COVID-19 WHICH DISRUPTED HIV CARE AND THE SHIFT TO DOLUTEGRAVIR-BASED REGIMENS (A NEW ANTIRETROVIRAL MEDICATION TO CONTROL HIV INFECTION) COULD ALTER THE BURDEN OF UNSUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD AND NEW HIV INFECTIONS. TOGETHER WITH RESEARCHERS FROM THE FRENCH RESEARCH INSTITUTE INSERM, DR MAXIME INGHELS IS MODELLING THE SIZE AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PAEDIATRIC AND ADOLESCENT HIV EPIDEMIC IN COTE DIVOIRE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FRENCH NGO SOLTHIS, THE FRENCH INSTITUT DE RECHERCHE ET DVELOPPEMENT (IRD), AND THE GUINEAN CENTRE DE RECHERCHE ET DE FORMATION EN INFECTIOLOGIE (CERFID). WITH FUNDING FROM FRENCH AGENCY ON AIDS (ANRS) (424,000). DR MAXIME INGHELS IS ALSO INVESTIGATING THE IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF INJECTABLE ARV TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV IN SENEGAL AND CONTRIBUTED TO TWO RECENT NIH-FUNDED HIV RESEARCH PROJECTS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING AND REDUCING HIV INCIDENCE IN RURAL SOUTH AFRICA: THE HITS TRIALS CAN HIV HOT-SPOTS BE ERADICATED? (2.1M) AND CAUSAL PATHWAYS TO POPULATION HEALTH IMPACT OF HIV ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT (1.8M).
EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS NEEDED TO ENABLE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT INITIATION AMONG HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN. IN GUINEA, LESS THAN 2 OUT OF 10 HIV-EXPOSED CHILDREN ARE DIAGNOSED EARLY. WITHOUT DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT, THE MAJORITY OF INFECTED CHILDREN ARE LIKELY TO DIE IN THEIR FIRST MONTH OF LIFE. HOWEVER, IN CONAKRY, THERE ARE FEW LABORATORIES CAPABLE OF CARRYING OUT EARLY HIV DIAGNOSIS, AND TRAFFIC JAMS ARE A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE RAPID TRANSPORT OF BLOOD SAMPLES. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NGO SOLTHIS. THIS PROJECT LED BY LIIRH RESEARCHER DR MAXIME INGHELS AIMS TO EXPLORE THE USE OF UNCREWED DRONES AS A POTENTIAL SOLUTION TO THE DELAYS IN THE TRANSPORTATION OF BLOOD SAMPLES. THE RESEARCH IS INVESTIGATING THE CONDITIONS AND COSTS WHERE TRANSPORT BY DRONE WOULD BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN TRANSPORT BY MOTORBIKE. WHEN THE SAMPLES ARRIVE IN THE LABORATORY AT DONKA HOSPITAL THE "POINT OF CARE" MACHINE ALLOWS THE EARLY HIV DIAGNOSIS TEST TO BE CARRIED OUT IN 90 MINUTES, AND THE RESULT IS COMMUNICATED TO THE CARERS BY TELEPHONE. FAILURE FOR A SAMPLE TO ARRIVE IN TIME AT THE LABORATORY LEADS TO A POSTPONED ANALYSIS TILL THE FOLLOWING DAY OR RISKS HAVING THE MOTHER LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH HER BABY AND COMING BACK FOR THE RESULT AT A LATER DATE WHEN IT MAY BE TOO LATE FOR EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO BE INITIATED. WHEN A NEW-BORN IS DIAGNOSED IN TIME, HE OR SHE WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF BEING LINKED TO AN APPROPRIATE CARE PATHWAY, THEREBY INCREASING HIS OR HER CHANCES OF SURVIVAL. THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT FROM THE GUINEAN MINISTRIES OF HEALTH AND TRANSPORT, AND THE TEAM ARE DEVELOPING AN AMBITIOUS RESEARCH PROJECT TO TEST THIS TRANSPORT SYSTEM ON A LARGER SCALE.

GROUP THEORY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF MODERN ALGEBRA. GROUPS CAN BE REGARDED AS MEASURES OF SYMMETRY UNDERSTOOD IN THE MOST BROAD SENSE AS INVARIANTS UNDER "ADMISSIBLE" TRANSFORMATIONS, SPECIFIC TO EACH SUBJECT AREA. THE LANGUAGE OF GROUP THEORY IS THEREFORE USED THROUGHOUT MATHEMATICS, AS WELL AS IN NATURAL SCIENCES. ABSTRACT GROUP THEORY STUDIES THE INTRINSIC STRUCTURE OF GROUPS, WHICH ARE QUITE FASCINATING OBJECTS FROM THE PURE MATHEMATICAL POINT OF VIEW.
ONE OF THE DIFFICULTIES IN THE STUDY OF GROUPS IS THAT THE GROUP OPERATION IS NOT COMMUTATIVE, AND GROUPS IN GENERAL DO NOT HAVE ANY LINEAR STRUCTURE. BUT CERTAIN CLASSES OF GROUPS ARE CLOSER TO BEING COMMUTATIVE THAN OTHERS. SPECIAL METHODS ARE USED TO CONSTRUCT LINEAR STRUCTURES FROM THE GROUP, SUCH AS A VECTOR SPACE, OR ALIERING. THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO APPLY THE TECHNIQUE OF LINEAR ALGEBRA: FOR EXAMPLE, AN AUTOMORPHISM OF A GROUP CAN SOMETIMES BE REGARDED AS A LINEAR TRANSFORMATION, FOR WHICH THERE ARISE EIGENSPACES, JORDAN NORMAL FORM, ETC. THIS ILLUMINATES THE GROUP IN A NEW "LINEAR" LIGHT, AND A PROBLEM BECOMES EASIER TO HANDLE.
IN THE THEORY OF FINITE GROUPS, MANY PROBLEMS NOWADAYS CAN BE REDUCED TO SOLUBLE AND NILPOTENT GROUPS BY USING THE CLASSIFICATION OF FINITE SIMPLE GROUPS. FURTHER STUDY OF SOLUBLE GROUPS BASED ON REPRESENTATION THEORY PROVIDES FURTHER REDUCTIONS TO NILPOTENT GROUPS. THE LATTER IN TURN ARE OFTEN STUDIED BY USINGLIERING METHODS.
ONE OF THE DIRECTIONS OF OUR RESEARCH IN ALGEBRA IS THE STUDY OF AUTOMORPHISMS WITH RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR FIXED POINTS, WITH THE AIM OF ACHIEVING GREATER COMMUTATIVITY OF THE GROUP, OR OF A SUITABLE LARGE SUBGROUP. ANOTHER STRONGPOINT IS DEVELOPING NOVELLIERING METHODS, AS WELL AS PROVING RESULTS ONLIERINGS AND THEIR AUTOMORPHISMS, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED TO GROUPS.
S RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED IN INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION. THE BRAZILIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL CNPQ PROVIDED A SPECIAL VISITING RESEARCHER GRANT FOR PROF EVGENY KHUKHRO, WHO REGULARLY VISITS UNIVERSITY OF BRASILIA FOR JOINT RESEARCH ON APPLICATION OF HALLHIGMANTYPE THEOREMS ANDLIERING METHODS, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING NEW LENGTH-TYPE PARAMETERS FOR NONSOLUBLE FINITE GROUPS WITH APPLICATIONS TO PROFINITE GROUPS. COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITIES OF ANKARA AND DOGUS UNIVERSITY IN ISTANBUL RESULTED IN NEW HALLHIGMANTYPE RESULTS FOR FROBENIUSTYPE GROUPS OF AUTOMORPHISMS. IN SEVERAL JOINT PAPERS WITH RESEARCHERS IN NOVOSIBIRSK (RUSSIA), MULHOUSE (FRANCE), AND BRASILIA,LIERING METHODS WERE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED FOR STUDYING NILPOTENT GROUPS AND THEIR AUTOMORPHISMS.", '

THE LINCOLN POLICY HUB WAS LAUNCHED IN MAY 2021 TO BRING TOGETHER THE LATEST INSIGHTS, EVIDENCE AND COMMENTARY FROM OUR RESEARCHERS, IN A COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE FOR BOTH ACADEMICS AND POLICYMAKERS.
IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY PETITIONING IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. AT THE NATIONAL AND DEVOLVED LEVELS PETITIONS SYSTEMS NOW EXIST IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT AND THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES. HOWEVER, DESPITE THEIR POPULARITY WITH THE PUBLIC, THE INTRODUCTION OF SUCH SYSTEMS HAVE NOT BEEN AN UNALLOYED SUCCESS.
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING CONTEMPORARY SOCIETIES, THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION, AND CONSEQUENTLY PARLIAMENTARY SCRUTINY, IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE. DRAWING ON INSIGHTS FROM A RANGE OF LITERATURES, THIS RESEARCH ANALYSED THE PASSAGE THROUGH PARLIAMENT, AND SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THOSE CENTRALLY INVOLVED WITH THEM, OF TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION  THE NATIONAL MINIMUM WAGE ACT 1998 AND THE ACADEMIES ACT 2010.
PARLIAMENT AND WELFARE POLICY: THE 2010 INTAKE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
THIS BRIEF REPORT PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF RESEARCH UNDERTAKEN DURING THE 2010 PARLIAMENT DRAWING UPON INTERVIEWS WITH 29 MPS ELECTED AT THE 2010 GENERAL ELECTION. IT BEGINS WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE INTAKE, BEFORE MOVING ON TO CONSIDER THEIR ATTITUDES TO A VARIETY OF SOCIAL POLICY TOPICS, INCLUDING SOME COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THAT AREA.
IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, PETITIONING IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION. THIS RESEARCH FOCUSED ON PETITIONS SYSTEMS IN THE LIGHT OF THE INCREASING USE OF PETITIONING AS A PARTICIPATORY TOOL. IT DREW UPON CASE STUDIES OF PETITIONS SYSTEMS FROM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY FOR WALES, WOLVERHAMPTON CITY COUNCIL, AN URBAN UNITARY COUNCIL IN ENGLAND, AND RENFREWSHIRE COUNCIL IN SCOTLAND.
FAMILIES WORKING TOGETHER (FWT) IS AN INTERVENTION PROJECT DESIGNED BY LINCOLNSHIRECOUNTY COUNCIL (LCC) TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES IN LINCOLNSHIRE WHO AREEXPERIENCING MULTIPLE, COMPLEX NEEDS. THE PROJECT AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW A BROAD RANGE OFPUBLIC, PRIVATE AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR ORGANISATIONS CAN WORK TOGETHER MORE EFFICIENTLY ANDEFFECTIVELY TO THIS END. THE PROJECT WAS ONE OF 16 COMMUNITY BUDGET PILOTS PROMOTED BYTHE GOVERNMENT ACROSS ENGLAND.
THIS RESEARCH, FUNDED BY THE LEVERHULME TRUST, EXAMINEDTHE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT AND PARLIAMENTARIANS IN THE SCRUTINYOF THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY AGENCIES AS IT HAS DEVELOPEDSINCE THE SECURITY SERVICE ACT 1989. PREVIOUS RESEARCHHAS FOCUSED OVERWHELMINGLY ON THE INTELLIGENCE ANDSECURITY COMMITTEE, AND WHILE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEEFORMED AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROJECT, THE STUDY ALSOLOOKED MORE BROADLY AT THE SCRUTINY OF INTELLIGENCEAND SECURITY ISSUES WITHIN PARLIAMENT AS A WHOLE, WITH APARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF PARLIAMENTARYINTEREST AND UNDERSTANDING.

FROM THE MID-2000S, HUGH BOCHEL AND ANDREW DEFTY HAVE UNDERTAKEN INTERVIEWS WITH MPS AND PEERS TO EXPLORE THEIR ATTITUDES TO SOCIAL POLICY ISSUES (SUCH AS THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN PROVIDING WELFARE, HOW WELFARE PROVISION SHOULD BE FINANCED, AND MORE SPECIFIC ISSUES SUCH AS THE NHS AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM), AND ALSO THEIR VIEWS ON THE ROLE OF PARLIAMENT IN SCRUTINISING THE ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENT.
RESEARCH BY SAMANTHA SHAVE EXAMINES PAST PARLIAMENTS ROLE IN THE MAKING AND BREAKING OF WELFARE POLICIES. IN PARTICULAR, SAMANTHA IS INTERESTED IN THE DEVELOPMENT, IMPACT AND DISCONTINUATION OF POOR RELIEF POLICIES AND PRACTICES IN ENGLAND, AND HOW PEOPLE FROM ALL AREAS OF SOCIETY WERE INVOLVED IN THIS PAST POLICY PROCESS. THIS RESEARCH HAS CULMINATED INPAUPER POLICIES: POOR LAW PRACTICE IN ENGLAND, 1780-1850AND A PAPER INTHE HISTORICAL JOURNAL.
USING A POLICY PROCESS PERSPECTIVE, SAMANTHA HAS DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY WELFARE SCANDALS, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE CENTRALISATION OF POOR LAW ADMINISTRATION IN 1834. SCANDALS IMPACTED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF WELFARE POLICIES, AND ALSO ALLOWED FOR THE OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF THE POOREST TO REACH PARLIAMENT. AN ESSAY IN THE EDITED COLLECTIONMEDICINE AND THE WORKHOUSEAND MORE RECENTLY A PAPER INCONTINUITY AND CHANGEHAVE EXAMINED THE ROLE OF SCANDALS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL AND CHILD TREATMENT POLICIES RESPECTIVELY.
KEY TO THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN THE COMPLEX LINKAGE OF VARIOUS DOCUMENTS HELD IN THE PARLIAMENTARY ARCHIVES, THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, DIGITALISED COLLECTIONS OF BRITISH PARLIAMENTARY PAPERS AND HANSARDS PARLIAMENTARY DEBATES, AS WELL AS LOCAL RECORD OFFICES. SAMANTHA IS NOW UNDERTAKING RESEARCH INTO WELFARE SCANDALS PRIOR TO 1834, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DETERRENT WORKHOUSE SYSTEMS BEYOND ENGLAND.
THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE INCREASE IN LEGISLATURE SIZE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES SOCIAL WELFARE. INCREASING THE CITY COUNCIL SIZE BY ONE LEGISLATOR LOWERS INFANT MORTALITY BY 2.01 CHILDREN PER ONE THOUSAND INFANTS BORN AND REDUCES POST-NEONATAL MORTALITY BY 0.90 CHILDREN PER ONE THOUSAND INFANTS WHO SURVIVED THEIR FIRST 28 DAYS. LARGER COUNCILS ALSO INCREASE ENROLMENT BY 2.58 CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION CLASSROOMS WITHOUT REDUCING SCHOOL QUALITY.
S PRE-ELECTORAL COALITION. THEREFORE, MAYORS FACE LOWER BARGAINING COSTS IN LARGER LEGISLATURES AND ARE ABLE TO BOOST PUBLIC INVESTMENTS WITH FEWER CONSTRAINTS. EACH ADDITIONAL LEGISLATOR ALSO LEADS TO 104 POLITICALLY APPOINTED BUREAUCRATS, AND RESEARCH SHOWS THAT POLITICAL APPOINTEES IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICE PROVISION AND ENHANCE ACCOUNTABILITY IN BRAZIL.", 'TO ASSESS THE ROBUSTNESS OF THEIR RESULTS, DANILO AND HIS CO-AUTHORS ALSO SURVEYED 174 FORMER COUNCILLORS WHO SERVED DURING THE 2005-2008 TERM, THE PERIOD THEY ANALYSE IN THE ARTICLE. THE COUNCILLORS CONFIRM THAT MAYORS USE BUREAUCRATIC APPOINTMENTS AND POLITICAL FAVOURS TO SECURE LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT. THE FINDINGS ARE IN LINE WITH QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE FROM A NOVEL DATASET, COLLECTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDED 346,553 LAWS PASSED IN 63 MUNICIPALITIES. WHILE ALL MUNICIPALITIES MENTION PUBLIC GOODS IN THEIR LEGISLATION, THOSE WITH LARGER CITY COUNCILS HAD 15 PER CENT MORE PROPOSALS ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY.

DR CATHERINE BOCHEL FROM THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WAS ONE OF ONLY FIVE RESEARCHERS IN THE UK SELECTED FOR THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ACADEMIC FELLOWSHIP SCHEME, WHICH GRANTED HER RARE ACCESS TO PARLIAMENT. AS A FELLOW, DR BOCHEL HAD UNIQUE ACCESS TO THE PARLIAMENTARY ESTATE AND HOUSE SERVICES AND SHE WORKED WITH THE HOUSE TO BUILD PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF PARLIAMENT, AND INFORM, EVALUATE AND ENHANCE THE HOUSES WORK AND THAT OF ITS MEMBERS. DR BOCHEL MADE REGULAR VISITS TO WESTMINSTER AND WAS WORKING ALONGSIDE PARLIAMENTARY STAFF AND POLITICIANS TO EXPLORE HOW EFFECTIVELY PARLIAMENT ENGAGES WITH THE PUBLIC IN ITS DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES.
S RESEARCH EXAMINED WHETHER THE CONCEPT OF 'PROCEDURAL JUSTICE'  ENSURING THAT A FAIR PROCESS HAS BEEN FOLLOWED  CAN BE USED AS A FRAMEWORK TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH PARLIAMENT. SHE BEGAN HER RESEARCH BY SCOPING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH PARLIAMENT. THE SECOND PHASE DEVELOPED A FRAMEWORK TO MEASURE THE DEGREE OF VOICE AND PARTICIPATION. THIS INVOLVED INTERVIEWS WITH MPS, PEERS, CLERKS AND OTHER PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS.", 'DR BOCHEL SAID: "PARLIAMENT IS KEEN TO ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS, AND PEOPLE CAN NOW DO THIS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WHEN THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH PARLIAMENT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE PROCESS IS AS POSITIVE AS POSSIBLE. IN A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM PEOPLE MAY NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY ASK FOR, SO THEIR TREATMENT BY THE SYSTEM AND EXPERIENCE OF IT IS VERY IMPORTANT; FINAL DECISIONS ARE MADE BY ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, SO THE PUBLIC MUST BE ABLE TO SEE THAT THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IS FAIR AND TRANSPARENT."
THE ISSUE OF POLITICAL PARTICIPATION IS A HOT RESEARCH TOPIC FOR ACADEMICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNS SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES. OTHER EXPERTS AT LINCOLN EXPLORE YOUTH PARTICIPATION, AND HAVE WRITTEN BOOKS ON THE ISSUE, AS WELL AS THE DEVOLUTION OF POWERS TO LOCAL AUTHORITY LEVELS, AND HOW THE UKS SECURITY.
BEN HAS PUBLISHED A NUMBER OF JOURNAL ARTICLES, BOOK CHAPTERS AND A MONOGRAPH IN THIS AREA, WITHTHE LABOUR PARTY AND CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION(MUP, 2012) EXAMINING THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPULSORY CITIZENSHIP CLASSES IN SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND. MORE RECENTLY, BEN HAS BEEN RESEARCHING WITH BRADLEY ALLSOP HOW NEO-LIBERAL THOUGHT AND POLICIES HAVE IMPACTED ON YOUTH POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT IN THE UK, AND ALSO WHETHER THERE WAS A YOUTHQUAKE IN THE 2017 GENERAL ELECTION IN BRITAIN.
IN ADDITION, BEN HAS WRITTEN A BOOK WITH LEE JEROME AT MIDDLESEX UNIVERSITY ON THE RISE OF CHARACTER EDUCATION IN BRITAIN, WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY PALGRAVE IN SEPTEMBER 2019, AND WHICH CHALLENGES THE INDIVIDUALISTIC AND MORALISTIC IDEAS UNDERLYING THIS FORM OF EDUCATION, ARGUING THAT CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION, PROPERLY CONCEIVED, IS FAR MORE LIKELY TO STRENGTHEN BRITISH DEMOCRACY.
ENGAGING WITH PARLIAMENTS IN THE UK AND BEYOND
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN HAS A RECORD OF UNDERTAKING RESEARCH INTO POLICY, PARLIAMENTS AND OTHER KEY POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. IT ALSO SEEKS TO BUILD UPON THIS TO ENSURE THAT RESEARCH INFORMS TEACHING AND THE WIDER EXPERIENCES OF STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS.
THE OVERALL AIM OF THE LINCOLN PARLIAMENTARY RESEARCH CENTRE (PARLILINC) IS TO ESTABLISH LINCOLN AS A RECOGNISED CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR RESEARCH AND TEACHING IN PARLIAMENTARY AND LEGISLATIVE STUDIES. IT HASFIVEBROAD AIMS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE RESEARCH, FACILITATE IMPACT, AND PROMOTE ENGAGEMENT WITH PARLIAMENTS AND LEGISLATURES IN THE UK AND BEYOND:

PARLIAMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT
THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN IS ONE OF 24 UK UNIVERSITIES RUNNING THEPARLIAMENTARY STUDIESMODULE WITH THE UK HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT. PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES IS AN UNDERGRADUATE MODULE CO-TAUGHT BY SCHOLARS FROM THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES AND OFFICIALS FROM THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT.
FOLLOWING A COMPETITIVE PROCESS THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN WAS SELECTED TO RUN THE MODULE FROM 2016. THE PROGRAMME WAS EXPANDED IN 2019 AND LINCOLN WAS DELIGHTED TO BE SELECTED ONCE AGAIN TO DELIVER THE PROGRAMME FOR A FURTHER FIVE YEARS.
PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES AT LINCOLN AIMS TO PROVIDE AN IN-DEPTH KNOWLEDGE OF HOW THE UK PARLIAMENT WORKS, IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE. IT FOCUSES ON PARLIAMENTS TWIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE EXECUTIVE AND WITH THE CITIZEN AND SITUATES THESE WITHIN BROADER THEORIES AND DEBATES ABOUT DEMOCRATIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE NATURE OF REPRESENTATION. THE MODULE LOOKS IN DETAIL AT PARTICULAR ASPECTS OF PARLIAMENTARY ACTIVITY, SUCH AS THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS, PARLIAMENTARY QUESTIONS AND DEBATES AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE SYSTEM, AND EXAMINES ONGOING DEBATES AROUND PARLIAMENTARY REFORM INCLUDING RESTORATION AND RENEWAL AND HOUSE OF LORDS REFORM.
THERE CAN BE NO BETTER TIME TO LEARN ABOUT POLITICS  HOW PARLIAMENT OPERATES AND TO HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE  THAN RIGHT NOW WHEN THE TOPIC IS ON EVERYONES MIND. OUR PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES MODULE BRINGS THE PROCEDURES OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND THE HOUSE OF LORDS TO LIFE, PROVIDING A WONDERFUL COMPLEMENT TO ON-CAMPUS TEACHING WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND SERVICES AIMED AT ENGAGING STUDENTS AND UNIVERSITY STAFF.
FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
IN ADDITION TO A SERIES OF VISITING SPEAKERS FROM THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, THE MODULE DRAWS ON THE EXTENSIVE EXPERTISE ON PARLIAMENT WITHIN THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES AND THE PARLILINC RESEARCH CENTRE, INCLUDING SESSIONS ON PETITIONS SYSTEMS, SCRUTINY OF THE EXECUTIVE AND REPRESENTATION. THE MODULE ALSO ENJOYS THE SUPPORT OF LOCAL MPS AND MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS WHO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO TEACHING ON THE MODULE.
A HIGHLIGHT OF THE MODULE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE ANNUAL VISIT TO WESTMINSTER TO WATCH PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS AND RECEIVE BRIEFINGS ON THE OPERATION OF PARLIAMENT FROM MEMBERS AND STAFF.
THE MODULE ALSO DRAWS ON THE INSIGHTS OF MEMBERS OF LINCOLNS ALUMNI NETWORK NOW WORKING AT WESTMINSTER. THIS INCLUDES GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES NOW SITTING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND A LARGE NUMBER OF LINCOLN GRADUATES NOW WORKING IN THE WESTMINSTER AND CONSTITUENCY OFFICES OF MPS. THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR THE INCLUSION OF A STRONG EMPLOYABILITY ELEMENT IN THE PROGRAMME WHICH EXPOSES CURRENT STUDENTS TO THE VARIOUS INTERESTING AND REWARDING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AT WESTMINSTER.
OUR ALUMNI HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SESSIONS ON WORKING IN PARLIAMENT AS PART OF THE ANNUAL VISIT TO WESTMINSTER AND IN LINCOLN, ENSURING THAT FOR SOME OF OUR GRADUATES AT LEAST, ENGAGEMENT WITH PARLIAMENT CONTINUES BEYOND THE PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES MODULE.
THE PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES MODULE IS COORDINATED BYDR ANDREW DEFTY.
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARLIAMENTARY STUDIES AT LINCOLN CONTINUE AT POSTGRADUATE LEVEL WITH A NEW COMPARATIVE LEGISLATURES MODULE OFFERED AS PART OF THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES MA IN POLITICS. THE COMPARATIVE LEGISLATURES MODULE ALLOWS STUDENTS TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM, STRUCTURE, ROLE AND IMPACT OF LEGISLATURE ACROSS A RANGE OF STATES. DRAWING ON THE WIDE RANGE OF EXPERTISE WITHIN THE SCHOOL THE MODULE FOCUSES ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LEGISLATIVE SYSTEMS THROUGH A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES WHICH EXAMINE THE OPERATION OF LEGISLATURES IN A NUMBER OF STATES INCLUDING THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE USA, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA AS WELL AS THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATIONS IN SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND.
THE MODULE ALSO AIMS TO PROVIDE THE STUDENTS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS BEYOND WESTMINSTER. STUDENTS ON THE MODULE THIS YEAR VISITED THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT.
THE COMPARATIVE LEGISLATURES MODULE IS COORDINATED BYDR MARK BENNISTER.
THROUGH THE ANNUAL SCHOOL OF SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES OVERSEAS STUDY TRIP STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT A RANGE OF INSTITUTIONS ACROSS EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA INCLUDING LEGISLATURES. AS PART OF THESE TRIPS STUDENTS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT AND RECEIVED BRIEFINGS AT LEGISLATURES INCLUDING THE US CONGRESS, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN BRUSSELS AND STRASBOURG, AND THE NATIONAL PARLIAMENTS OF GERMANY AND THE NETHERLANDS.
ISSUES OF DIVERSITY IN ELECTED BODIES HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN RECENT YEARS, PRIMARILY AROUND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES, BUT MORE RECENTLY IN RESPECT OF THE TREATMENT OF THOSE WORKING IN SUCH INSTITUTIONS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER WHO PARLIAMENTS HEAR FROM, WITH ONE CRUCIAL ELEMENT OF THAT BEING THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEES THAT SCRUTINISE LEGISLATION AND THE ACTIONS OF GOVERNMENTS.
DURING 2017, HUGH BOCHEL WAS AN ACADEMIC FELLOW OF THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT, AND USED ANALYSIS OF DATA ON WITNESSES AND INTERVIEWS WITH MSPS AND PARLIAMENTARY OFFICIALS TO DRAW UP AREPORT FOR THE PARLIAMENTHIGHLIGHTING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE UNDER-REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN AMONG COMMITTEE WITNESSES. AN ARTICLE DRAWING ON THE WORK HAS ALSO BEEN PUBLISHED INSOCIAL POLICY AND SOCIETY. ONGOING RESEARCH INCLUDES CONSIDERING DEVELOPMENTS AT THE SCOTTISHPARLIAMENT AND ALSO COMMITTEE WITNESSES AT WESTMINSTER.
HUGH IS NOW UNDERTAKING WORK ON WITNESSES TO PUBLIC BILL COMMITTEES IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.
THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LIAISON COMMITTEE AND THE PRIME MINISTER
THIS RESEARCH EXPLORES THE PRIME MINISTERS APPEARANCES AT THE LIAISON COMMITTEE. MARK BENNISTER WAS AWARDED APARLIAMENTARY FELLOWSHIP IN NOVEMBER 2016TO STUDY THESE SESSIONS, FOCUSING ON THE FUNCTIONING AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LIAISON COMMITTEE SESSIONS WITH THE PRIME MINISTER. THESE SESSIONS HAVE QUESTIONED FOUR PRIME MINISTERS SINCE 2002 AND PROVIDE A RICH SOURCE OF MATERIAL RELATING TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRIME MINISTER AND PARLIAMENT, ASIDE FROM APPEARANCES ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. THE RESEARCH HAS LED TO THE PUBLICATION OF A CO-AUTHORED BRIEFING ON THE LIAISON COMMITTEE WITH THE HOUSE OF COMMONS LIBRARY.
IN MARCH 2019, WRITTEN EVIDENCE ON THE PRIME MINISTERS APPEARANCESWAS PUBLISHEDAS PART OF THE LIAISON COMMITTEES INQUIRY INTO SELECT COMMITTEE EFFECTIVENESS.
MARK BENNISTER WAS PREVIOUSLY AWARDED 34,000 BY THE NUFFIELD FOUNDATION FROM 2015 TO 2016 TO RESEARCH THE SESSION.

CAREGIVING DADS, BREADWINNING MUMS: TRANSFORMING GENDER IN WORK AND CHILDCARE, A MAJOR MIXED-METHODS STUDY FUNDED BY THE NUFFIELD FOUNDATION, COMPARED COUPLES IN WHICH CHILDCARE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE SHARED EQUALLY, OR ASSUMED PRIMARILY BY THE FATHER, WITH MORE TRADITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS.
DRAWING ON SURVEY DATA FROM A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF BRITISH PARENTS, AS WELL AS IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH COUPLES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, THE STUDY FOUND THAT:
PROFESSOR RUTH GAUNT FROM THE RESEARCH TEAM SAID: CURRENT PARENTING LEAVE POLICIES RESTRICT COUPLES CHOICES AND STEER THEM INTO A TRADITIONAL DIVISION OF FAMILY ROLES DESPITE THEIR BELIEFS, PREFERENCES, AND PARENTING ARRANGEMENTS.U202FPARENTS WANT TO SEE MORE PART TIME AND FLEXIBLE WORKING AND LEAVE POLICIES AND CHILDCARE THAT ENABLE BOTH PARENTS TO RETURN TO WORK AFTER PARENTING LEAVE.
DR MARY-ANN STEPHENSON, DIRECTOR OF THE WOMENS BUDGET GROUP, ADDED: WE KNOW THAT MODERN PARENTS WANT TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY, SHARING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARE AND EARNING MORE EQUALLY WITH THEIR PARTNERS. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT TOO MANY FEEL PUSHED INTO A SPLIT BETWEEN BREADWINNER OR CARER BY OUT OF DATE LEAVE POLICIES, LACK OF FLEXIBLE WORK AND INADEQUATE CHILDCARE.
UNPAID CARE IS AT THE HEART OF WOMENS ECONOMIC INEQUALITY. WOMEN DO 60 PER CENT MORE UNPAID CARE THAN MEN, MEANING THEY HAVE LESS TIME FOR PAID WORK, SO THEY EARN LESS, OWN LESS AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE POOR. THIS CAN BE CHANGED THROUGH LEAVE POLICIES, FLEXIBLE WORK, AND CHILDCARE THAT REFLECT PARENTS WISHES AND WOULD BE BETTER FOR CHILDREN.

MEMBERS OF THE VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY RESEARCH GROUP
THE VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY RESEARCH GROUP IS COMPRISED OF ACADEMICS AND POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY WHO ARE RESEARCHING VIOLENCE IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS. THE GROUP MAINTAINS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF VIOLENCE TO ENSURE RECOGNITION OF ITS INTERPERSONAL, SYMBOLIC, AND STRUCTURAL NATURE.
THE CAUSES OF VIOLENCE ARE DIVERSE, REQUIRING INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION TO DEVELOP ENHANCED UNDERSTANDING. THE GROUP ADOPTS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO BRING TOGETHER DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON VIOLENCE AND TO WORK TOWARDS DEVELOPING MORE EFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO SUPPORT VICTIMS AND ADDRESS PERPETRATION.
WHILE SOME RECORDED MEASURES OF VIOLENT CRIMES INDICATE A RECENT DECLINE IN THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS THE UK AND USA, THE UNITED NATIONS STATES THAT THE NUMBER OF RECORDED HOMICIDES IS INCREASING IN SOME OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, WHILE GENDER-BASED ATTACKS ARE REPORTEDLY INCREASING GLOBALLY. UNICEF FOUND RECENTLY THAT CONSIDERABLE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE OR LIVE WITH A MOTHER WHO IS A VICTIM OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE.
UNICEF STATES THAT EXPERIENCING VIOLENCE UNDERMINES CHILDRENS SENSE OF SELF-WORTH AND HINDERS THEIR DEVELOPMENT, WHILE A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF EVIDENCE LINKS EXPERIENCES OF VIOLENCE IN CHILDHOOD WITH A RANGE OF POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES IN ADULTHOOD. THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENCE FOR THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING OF THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, ARE CONSIDERABLE AND PRESENT A VARIETY OF CHALLENGES FOR HEALTH AND JUSTICE SERVICES GLOBALLY.
S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS, NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.", 'SUPPORTING OUR RESEARCHERS
THROUGH A SERIES OF REGULAR ACTIVITIES, THE GROUP PROVIDES A SUPPORTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR RESEARCHERS. THE UNIVERSITY POSSESSES A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON DIFFERENT FORMS OF VIOLENCE, INCLUDING VIOLENCE BETWEEN AND AFFECTING YOUNG PEOPLE, GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE, SUICIDE, AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE.
THE VIOLENCE IN SOCIETY RESEARCH GROUP SEEKS TO CAPITALISE ON THE PRODUCTIVE RESEARCH RELATIONSHIPS THAT EXIST ACROSS SCHOOLS AT THE UNIVERSITY, PROVIDING A SUPPORTIVE, INTELLECTUALLY STIMULATING FORUM THAT ALLOWS RESEARCHERS AND POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS TO CONNECT AND COLLABORATE.

BY 2027, WE EXPECT TO HAVE A LARGER AND MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT BODY, INCREASING FROM SEVEN PER CENT TO 28 PER CENT, WITH A HIGHER PROPORTION OF POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT STUDENTS. THIS, IN TURN, WILL REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON THE HOME UNDERGRADUATE TUITION FEE. 
TO IMPLEMENT THE UNIVERSITYS STRATEGIC PLAN THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY AREAS WHICH REQUIRE INVESTMENT, TO WORK TOWARDS THE KEY MILESTONE OF A TOP 40 POSITION IN THE UK.
WORKING TOWARDS NET ZERO THROUGH DEVELOPING AN INCREASINGLY ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE CAMPUS, THAT IS BOTH INCLUSIVE AND ACCESSIBLE, WHILE ENSURING A SAFE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR STUDENTS, STAFF AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY.
TO BE AN INSTITUTION WHERE SUSTAINABILITY IS A CORE VALUE RUNNING THROUGHOUT OUR ACTIVITIES AND WE ARE RECOGNISED FOR OUR LOCAL AND GLOBAL IMPACT AND LEADERSHIP IN THE TRANSITION TO NET ZERO.
WE ENCOURAGE INNOVATIVE IDEAS TO REDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, HARNESSING THE CREATIVITY OF OUR COLLEAGUES, STUDENTS, AND PARTNERS TO DELIVER SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR INSTITUTION AND THE WORLD.
CLEARLY SIGNPOSTING THE SDGS IN OUR RESEARCH OUTPUTS, DELIVERING RESEARCH IN ALL SDG AREAS AND TRACKING OUR IMPACT.
ENSURING OUR RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED FOLLOWING BEST SUSTAINABLE PRACTICE.
OUR STUDENTS WILL LEARN ABOUT DISCIPLINE-RELEVANT SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR CAMPUSES.
EMBEDDING SUSTAINABILITY IN ALL CURRICULA, ENSURING OUR GRADUATES ARE MEETING RELEVANT EMPLOYER NEEDS. STUDENTS WILL ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTRIBUTE TO SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS RUN BY THE UNIVERSITY AND THE STUDENTS UNION.
ENSURING STUDENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THEIR OWN ACTIONS AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITYS TRANSITION TO NET ZERO.
WE HAVE A COMMUNITY APPROACH TO SUSTAINABILITY INVOLVING STAFF, STUDENTS, AND THE PUBLIC.
RECOGNISING THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL OF US IN ACHIEVING OUR SUSTAINABILITY GOALS.
RECOGNISING THAT SUSTAINABILITY PRESENTS COMPLEX PROBLEMS WITH INTERDISCIPLINARY SOLUTIONS, AND ALL AREAS OF THE UNIVERSITY CAN CONTRIBUTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  
USING THE TIMES HIGHER EDUCATION IMPACT RANKINGS TO MEASURE OUR IMPACT AND IMPROVE IT, YEAR ON YEAR.
SUBMITTING CASE STUDIES OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL RECOGNITION, SUCH AS THE GREEN GOWN AWARDS.
THE REGIONAL STRATEGY OBJECTIVE IS TO ENSURE THE UNIVERSITY MEETS ITS CIVIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMMITMENT TO MAKING A REAL DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLES LIVES, INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES, AND SUPPORTING THE REGIONS PROSPERITY AGENDA. THE STRATEGY AIMS TO ALIGN AS APPROPRIATE:
UNIVERSITY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT PROVISION AND THOSE AREAS AND FIELDS IN WHICH THE UNIVERSITY IS ALREADY HEAVILY ENGAGED WITH INDUSTRY AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES (E.G. ENGINEERING, ENERGY, DEFENCE AND SECURITY, AGRI-TECH, FOOD PROCESSING, HEALTH AND WELLBEING). TOGETHER THESE ACTIVITIES CAN DELIVER NEW AND INCLUSIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REGION.
BEING FOR AND OF GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE GIVES THE UNIVERSITYS APPROACH ITS DISTINCTIVE CHARACTER. OUR STRENGTHS HAVE GROWN ROUND THE ASSETS OF THE REGION. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A RANGE OF INITIATIVES AND RESEARCH EXPERTISE BASED ON THE NEED TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT INEQUALITIES ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHY.
KEY TO THE SUCCESS OF THE STRATEGY ARE COHERENCE, FOCUS, AND THE PRINCIPLE OF REINFORCING SUCCESS IN ORDER TO MAXIMISE THE SYNERGY OF THE UNIVERSITYS EFFORTS ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO HORIZON SCAN AND REMAIN AGILE AS EXTERNAL PRIORITIES AND POLICIES EVOLVE OR CHANGE.
SECTORS IN WHICH THE REGION HAS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE AND OFFER REAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE AGRI-FOOD, MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, HEALTH AND CARE, PORTS AND LOGISTICS, DEFENCE AND SECURITY, AND VISITOR ECONOMY.
FROM THESE SECTORS, THE GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE LOCAL ENTERPRISE PARTNERSHIP (GLLEP) HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY SECTORS WHICH PRESENT GAME-CHANGING, HIGH-POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH, INVESTMENT, AND COLLABORATION ON A REGION-WIDE SCALE: THE HUMBER FREEPORT (TRANSFORMING THE HUMBER PORTS INTO ONE OF THE MOST SMART, CLEAN, AND EFFICIENT PORT CLUSTERS IN THE WORLD), UK FOOD VALLEY (CHAMPIONING AUTOMATION AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND REDUCING THE UKS RELIANCE ON FOOD IMPORTS), GREEN ENERGY (HOME TO THE WORLDS LARGEST WIND FARM THE REGION WILL CAPITALISE ON ITS CLEAN GROWTH ASSETS BY ACTING AS A TEST-BED FOR TECHNOLOGIES IN CLEAN ENERGY, STORAGE, AND DISTRIBUTION), AND DEFENCE AND SECURITY (CREATING A CLUSTER OF INNOVATION-FOCUSED DEFENCE AND SECURITY COMPANIES TO ENSURE GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE IS THE FIRST CHOICE LOCATION FOR DEFENCE-RELATED INDUSTRIES). 
THE FREEPORT RUNS ALONG THE HUMBER ENCOMPASSING N AND NE LINCS, INCLUDING SCUNTHORPE AND GRIMSBY; THE FOOD VALLEY NORTH TO SOUTH FROM GRIMSBY (FISH AND PROTEIN) THROUGH HOLBEACH (NATIONAL CENTRE FOR FOOD MANUFACTURING (NCFM)) TO BOSTON; GREEN ENERGY FOCUSED ALONG THE HUMBER AND EAST COAST; AND DEFENCE AND SECURITY CLUSTERED AROUND LINCOLN AND THE RAF BASES ACROSS GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE.
SUPPORTING THE GROWTH OF THE BURGEONING CREATIVE INDUSTRIES SECTOR, THE UNIVERSITY IS SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF INITIATIVES ACROSS THE REGION, WHICH BUILD CAPACITY AND DRIVE THE SKILLS AGENDA THROUGH ECONOMIC INCLUSION ACTIVITY AND BUSINESS SUPPORT (E.G. BARBICAN CREATIVE HUB AND GRIMSBY CREATES).
ALONGSIDE THESE REGIONAL ADVANTAGES, PARTNERS HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE BARRIERS CONSTRAINING OPPORTUNITY. THE UNIVERSITYS REGIONAL INEQUALITY COMMISSION HAS IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING FACTORS AS CONTRIBUTING TO INEQUALITY: HEALTH AND WELLBEING; COMMUNITY, BELONGING, AND RECOVERY; EDUCATION, SKILLS, AND THE LABOUR MARKET; INNOVATION, INVESTMENT, AND AMBITION; PLACE, CULTURE, AND CONNECTIVITY. THE UNIVERSITY ALREADY UNDERTAKES SIGNIFICANT ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS ISSUES IN THESE AREAS OF CONCERN; THE REGIONAL STRATEGY WILL DRAW THESE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER TO INCREASE CONNECTIONS ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY AND BEYOND, SO ITS WORK HAS MAXIMUM EFFECT.
THE GOVERNMENTS LEVELLING UP AGENDA AND GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE TOWN FUND DEALS FOCUS ON LINCOLN, SCUNTHORPE, GRIMSBY, CONNECTED COAST (MABLETHORPE AND SKEGNESS), AND BOSTON.
ON THE LINCOLNSHIRE BORDER, NEWARK ALSO SECURED A TOWN FUND DEAL. THE UNIVERSITY IS A MEMBER OF ALL THESE TOWN FUND BOARDS, WHICH ARE SEEKING TO ADDRESS DEPRIVATION, LACK OF OPPORTUNITY AND LOW ASPIRATION, AND ACCESS TO HIGH SKILL, HIGH VALUE, BETTER PAID JOBS.
TWO OF THE FIRST FOUR GOVERNMENT GRAND CHALLENGES, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND DATA (INCLUDING A SPECIFIC MISSION TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES) AND CLEAN GROWTH, ALIGN WITH THE REGIONS KEY SECTORS AND GAME CHANGERS AND THE UNIVERSITYS RKE STRATEGY (I.E. MANUFACTURING AND CLEAN GROWTH, GREEN ENERGY, HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE, AND DEFENCE AND SECURITY).
PARALLELING THE INCREASING EMPHASIS ON ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS THAT OF FOOD INDEPENDENCE AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE, WHICH ALIGN WITH THE REGIONS DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOOD VALLEY, FREEPORT AND LOGISTICS, AND THE UNIVERSITYS FOCUS ON AGRI-TECH, NET ZERO, AND DEFENCE AND SECURITY.
KEY TO SUCCESS WILL BE THE UNIVERSITYS ABILITY TO WORK WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS TO BUILD LONG-TERM PLANS AND PROGRAMMES KNITTING TOGETHER A FRAGMENTED FUNDING AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM EFFECT. FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE CREATIVE AND HERITAGE SECTORS, THE UNIVERSITY IS PROVIDING STRATEGIC AND DELIVERY SUPPORT ACROSS SEVERAL TOWNS FUND PROGRAMMES, ENHANCING COHERENCE, AND LEVERAGING FUNDS.
THE UNIVERSITYS RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE STRATEGY IDENTIFIES AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY, DEFENCE, NET ZERO, AND RURAL HEALTH AS PRIORITY CLUSTERS FOR ITS INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH.
THESE AREAS ALIGN WITH THE REGIONS DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES (UK FOOD VALLEY, GREEN ENERGY, DEFENCE AND SECURITY), GOVERNMENT LEVELLING UP, AND GRAND CHALLENGE INITIATIVES (E.G. ADDRESSING DEPRIVATION AND POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH TOWN FUND INVESTMENT AND USE OF AI AND DATA, CLEAN GROWTH, AND THE FREEPORT), AND THE UNIVERSITYS EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT AND INTERVENTIONS(E.G. ACADEMY TRUST, LIOT, AND NCFM).
THE UNIVERSITYS INDUSTRIAL ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY SUPPORTS ITS CIVIC AND REGIONAL ENGAGEMENT ENSURING RESEARCH AND TEACHING IS RELEVANT AND EFFECTIVE.
THE LINCOLNSHIRE SCIENCE AND INNOVATION PARK (LSIP) ADJACENT TO THE UNIVERSITYS LINCOLN CAMPUS HAS AND IS ATTRACTING BUSINESSES KEEN TO ACCESS THE UNIVERSITYS ACADEMICS, RESEARCH AND INNOVATION FACILITIES, AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITY. MANY OF THESE COMPANIES ALIGN WITH THE UNIVERSITYS RESEARCH PRIORITY CLUSTERS OUTLINED ABOVE.
IN ADDITION, THE UNIVERSITYS POLICY ENGAGEMENT CAPABILITY HAS IDENTIFIED CORE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE LINKAGES BETWEEN RESEARCH FINDINGS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY INTERVENTIONS TO ACHIEVE EFFECT AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL.
BEYOND ITS UNDERGRADUATE AND POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMMES, MANY OF WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH LOCAL AND NATIONAL EMPLOYERS (E.G. ENGINEERING AND SIEMENS), THE UNIVERSITY HAS SOUGHT TO REACH OUT ACROSS THE REGION TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS AND FILL GAPS.
THE UNIVERSITY LED THE BID TO ESTABLISH A LINCOLNSHIRE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (LIOT) WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH BAKKAVOR AND OAL LTD AND SEVEN FE COLLEGES: DN COLLEGES GROUP (SCUNTHORPE), THE TEC PARTNERSHIP (GRIMSBY), LINCOLN COLLEGE, LINCOLN UNIVERSITY TECHNICAL COLLEGE, BISHOP BURTON COLLEGE, BOSTON COLLEGE, AND GRANTHAM COLLEGE.
S PRIORITY THEMES OF BUSINESS GROWTH AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT IN AGRI-FOOD, FOOD MANUFACTURING, ENERGY, DIGITAL, AND ENGINEERING SHARING THE COMMON THEME OF INDUSTRY 4.0.", 'THE UNIVERSITYS NCFM IS BASED IN HOLBEACH AT THE CENTRE OF THE REGIONS FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRY AND IS COLLOCATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY ACADEMY HOLBEACH PROVIDING EDUCATION AND STRONG EMPLOYMENT PATHWAYS INTO THE AGRI-FOOD INDUSTRY. NCFMS LIOT FACILITY AND THE UNIVERSITYS CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR FOOD INDUSTRY INNOVATION ARE LOCATED ON THE SOUTH LINCOLNSHIRE FOOD ENTERPRISE ZONE. 
THE UNIVERSITYS WORK TO INCREASE ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION IS A CORE ACTIVITY TO SUPPORT THE FUTURE REGIONAL ECONOMY IN AN AREA WHERE PROGRESSION RATES FROM SCHOOL TO HE ARE VERY LOW AND RECRUITMENT TO GRADUATE LEVEL EMPLOYMENT A CHALLENGE. OUR WHOLE-INSTITUTION APPROACH IS CENTRED ON SEEKING LOCAL SOLUTIONS, AS REFERENCED IN THE ACCESS AND PARTICIPATION PLAN. SUPPORTING STRONG GRADUATE OUTCOMES IS A KEY ELEMENT OF IMPROVING SOCIAL MOBILITY AND IS UNDERPINNED BY WORKING WITH REGIONAL EMPLOYERS TO INCREASE DEMAND FOR HIGH-LEVEL SKILLS.
CIVIC MISSION IS AT THE HEART OF THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. WE ARE HERE FOR THE LONG TERM, WORKING WITH REGIONAL PARTNERS TOWARDS A SHARED ENDEAVOUR OF REGIONAL HEALTH, WEALTH, AND OPPORTUNITY.
THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF COHERENCE BETWEEN THE FOUR AREAS (REGIONAL PRIORITIES, GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES, UNIVERSITY RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE, AND UNIVERSITY EDUCATION PROVISION) SET OUT ABOVE IN TERMS OF SUBJECT MATTER AND LOCATION. FOUR OF THE SIX GREATER LINCOLNSHIRE TOWNS FUND LOCATIONS HAVE A LIOT FACILITY (LINCOLN, SCUNTHORPE, GRIMSBY, AND BOSTON).
THE GOVERNMENT FOCUS ON THE HUMBER AND NE LINCOLNSHIRE COAST FOR GREEN ENERGY, CLEAN GROWTH (INCLUDES DECARBONISATION AND CARBON CAPTURE, USE AND STORAGE (CCUS)) AND NET ZERO DEVELOPMENT ENCOMPASSES SCUNTHORPE, GRIMSBY, AND MABLETHORPE AND ALIGNS WITH THE UNIVERSITYS RKE AND EDUCATION ENGAGEMENT. THE HUMBER FREEPORT ALSO ENCOMPASSES SCUNTHORPE, GRIMSBY, CLEAN GROWTH, TOWN FUND, AND LIOT.
THE UK FOOD VALLEY DEVELOPMENT ALIGNS WITH THE UNIVERSITYS RKE AND EDUCATION PROVISION (IN LINCOLN, HOLBEACH  LIOT AND UNIVERSITY ACADEMY TRUST  AND GRIMSBY). THE RKE DEFENCE AND SECURITY FOCUS ALIGNS WITH A REGIONAL GAME CHANGER, THE GOVERNMENTS DEFENCE AND SECURITY INDUSTRIAL AND NET ZERO STRATEGIES, AI AND DATA GRAND CHALLENGE AND LSIP DEVELOPMENT. THE CHALLENGES OF RURAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE OUTCOMES ALIGN WITH RKE, LEVELLING UP, AND A REGIONAL GROWTH SECTOR.
THIS ALIGNMENT OF GOVERNMENT, REGIONAL, AND UNIVERSITY FOCUS BRINGS COHERENCE TO THE EFFORT AND RESOURCE THE UNIVERSITY CAN BRING TO BEAR TO MAKE A REGIONAL DIFFERENCE. REINFORCING UNIVERSITY SUCCESS IN EDUCATION, LEVELLING UP, AGRI-FOOD TECHNOLOGY, DEFENCE AND SECURITY, CREATIVE SECTOR, NET ZERO, AND RURAL HEALTH IN THE KEY LOCATIONS OF LINCOLN, HUMBER SOUTH BANK, CONNECTED COAST, AND BOSTON/HOLBEACH WILL DELIVER MAXIMUM REGIONAL IMPACT.
THE UNIVERSITY WILL SEEK BETTER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IT CAN DRAW TOGETHER ITS ASSETS TO HAVE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON REGIONAL INEQUALITY OVER THE LONG TERM. THIS MEANS, ALONGSIDE THE FOCUS ON BUILDING REGIONAL OPPORTUNITY THROUGH KEY SECTORS AND CLUSTERS, WE WILL ALSO FOCUS ON SOCIAL IMPACT. WE WILL COMBINE OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RESOURCES AND CAPABILITY AND WORK WITH A SIGNIFICANT BREADTH OF THIRD SECTOR ORGANISATIONS WITH WHOM WE COLLABORATE TO SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH WILL BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS SECTORS AND ORGANISATIONS.
EACH OF OUR STUDENT CONSULTANTS WERE INTERVIEWED FOR THEIR SPECIALISED THEME AND SHOWED A PASSION FOR BRINGING IMPROVEMENTS TO STUDENT LIFE, CONFIDENCE, ACADEMIC PROGRESS, AND THEIR SOCIAL SKILLS. ONE CONSULTANT WAS RECRUITED FOR EACH OF THE PROJECT THEMES.
 UNION'S VICE PRESIDENT EDUCATION AND GROUP DEPUTY CHIEF EXECUTIVE, WITH A UNIVERSITY STAFF MEMBER, THE DEAN OF THE LINCOLN ACADEMY OF LEARNING AND TEACHING (LALT) ALSO ON THE APPOINTMENT PANEL. THE STUDENT CONSULTANTS WERE SUPPORTED INSTITUTIONALLY THROUGH LALT, WITH RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING BEING PROVIDED BY THE STUDENTS' UNION. TO ASSIST STUDENT CONSULTANTS IN THEIR ROLE, A SUITE OF SUPPORT AND TRAINING WAS ESTABLISHED TO GUIDE THEM, EMPHASISING THE COMMITMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS' UNION, WITH A FOCUS ON ENHANCING STUDENT EXPERIENCES.", 'GRACE SMITH
"THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS OPPORTUNITY, I HAVE GAINED SO MANY SKILLS AND EXPERIENCES FROM IT AND I HOPE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS COME TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE!"
WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM BEING A STUDENT CONSULTANT?
"I LEARNT SOME GREAT INTERVIEW SKILLS IN THE HIRING PROCESS, AND THEN I DEVELOPED MY REPORT WRITING SKILLS IN PUTTING THE FINAL PIECE TOGETHER, AS WELL AS MY PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT SKILLS IN TERMS OF GAINING FEEDBACK. THIS IS ONLY A FEW THINGS, BUT THE LIST COULD GO ON FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AS IT IS A VERY ENRICHING EXPERIENCE!
"MY STAFF MENTORS REALLY HELPED ME SEE EXPERIENCES FROM A VIEW WHICH IS NOT MY OWN AND HELPED ME DEVELOP MY IDEAS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THESE SKILLS, PARTICULARLY SEEING THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT VIEWPOINT, WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL IN MY NEXT CAREER STEPS."
"AS A STUDENT CONSULTANT, I GAINED AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND NUANCES INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF ALIGNING TEACHING METHODS WITH STUDENT EXPECTATIONS."
"AS A STUDENT CONSULTANT, I GAINED AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES AND NUANCES INVOLVED IN HIGHER EDUCATION, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF ALIGNING TEACHING METHODS WITH STUDENT EXPECTATIONS. THIS EXPERIENCE UNDERSCORED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH BOTH STUDENTS AND ACADEMIC FACULTY TO CO-CREATE SOLUTIONS THAT ELEVATE THE QUALITY OF THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. ADDITIONALLY, I LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION IN PRESENTING FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO STAKEHOLDER."WORKING WITH MY STAFF MENTOR, I HONED MY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT, CRITICAL THINKING, AND PRESENTATION SKILLS WHICH ARE VALUABLE AND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MY EFFECTIVENESS IN MANAGING PROJECTS, CONSULTING, AND MANAGING STAKEHOLDERS IN MY CAREER."
S EXPERIENCE IN AN INCLUSIVE WAY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR BACKGROUND, WAS TRULY INSPIRING. THIS JUST EMPHASISES THE POWER OF CO-CREATION AND REMINDS US ALL THAT STUDENTS AND STAFF WORKING IN GENUINE PARTNERSHIP YIELDS POWERFUL RESULTS FOR EVERYBODY.", 'JO RUSHWORTH
"WE HAD TO LEARN A LOT FOR THIS ROLE, WE NEEDED GOOD COMMUNICATION WITH STAFF AND COLLEGES, AS WELL AS TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO STUDENTS AND BE ABLE TO LISTEN WHILE CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THEIR ISSUES."
"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILLS WAS ORGANISATION AND COMMUNICATION, WITH BI-WEEKLY MEETINGS AND MAKING SURE REPORTS WERE UPDATED. WE HAD TO COMBINE TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ALONG WITH RESEARCH WE BUILT UP OVER THE WEEKS TOGETHER TO MAKE THE REPORT. THIS HAS GIVEN ME A GREAT EXPERIENCE DEALING WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS IT ALSO HELPED CRITICAL THINKING. LASTLY, IT HELPED TO DEVELOP MY DOCUMENTATION SKILLS THROUGH HAVING TO KEEP NOTES MEETINGS, STORING RESEARCH FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, AND DISPLAYING IT IN A WAY SO EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND, WHICH IS KEY IF I WANT TO TACKLE BIGGER PROJECTS IN LIFE."
OUR STUDENT CONSULTANT PROVIDED EXCELLENT INSIGHT ON WHAT WE ARE MISSING FROM A CAREERS SERVICE, THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AROUND ENGAGEMENT HAVE BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AS SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE CHANGES WE ARE ALREADY MAKING. IT HAS GIVEN THE SERVICE CONFIDENCE THAT THESE SPECIFIC CHANGES WERE THE RIGHT ONES TO MAKE.
"WORKING AS A STUDENT CONSULTANT HELPED ME FURTHER DEVELOP MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CURRICULUM."
"I FEEL AS A STUDENT CONSULTANT I WAS ABLE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. IT WAS INTERESTING AS I WAS ABLE TO WITNESS THE UNITY BETWEEN ALL DEPARTMENTS AND THE ENTHUSIASM TO WANTING TO IMPROVE THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE.
"WORKING AS A STUDENT CONSULTANT HELPED ME FURTHER DEVELOP MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSITY AND HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CURRICULUM. AS SOMEONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCES, I FEEL LIKE THIS UNDERSTANDING WILL HELP ME BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY ANY STRENGTHS OR WEAKNESSES IN THE FUTURE, WHEN I AM HOPEFULLY WORKING IN MEDICAL EDUCATION. I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A GREAT SKILL TO HAVE SO THAT I CAN ONE DAY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES TO THE MEDICAL EDUCATION SYSTEM."
IT WAS GREAT TO WORK WITH THE STUDENTS ON THIS PROJECT AND GET FRESH INSIGHTS AND IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO ENHANCE THE DIGITAL STUDENT EXPERIENCE. I HOPE ITS AN INITIATIVE THAT WILL BE REPEATED AS IT REALLY HAS BEEN VALUABLE TO US IN DIGITAL SERVICES.
STUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO | ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY | UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLNSTUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO
THE STUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO AIMS TO CREATE A SET OF ACTIONS AND COMMITMENTS TO ENHANCE THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. THE PROJECT HAS BUILT UPON THE WORK OF THE UPP STUDENT FUTURES COMMISSION, WHICH IDENTIFIED A BASELINE OF STUDENTS WHO HAD LOW CONFIDENCE, WHO WERE POTENTIALLY BEHIND IN ACADEMIC PROGRESS, AND HAD INCREASED ANXIETY AND A LOSS OF SOCIAL SKILLS FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE COMMISSION WANTED TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS, TO HELP PREPARE THEM FOR SUCCESSFUL CAREERS.
THE COMMISSION ARGUED FOR A MOVE TOWARDS KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY VALUES BEING CENTRAL IN INSTITUTIONS, WITH ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE BUILT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH STUDENTS. THIS PRACTICE EMPHASISES THE MOVE TOWARDS PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL SPACES, AN ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES LEARNING OVER TEACHING, AND FOSTERS A MODEL OF CO-CREATION, CREATING COMMUNITY, RATHER THAN SURFACE LEVEL ENGAGEMENT. THE PROJECT OUTLINED SIX KEY THEMES IN WHICH TO STRIVE FOR DEVELOPMENT. THE STUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO IS GUIDED BY THESE THEMES TO BEST SUPPORT STUDENTS AND DEVELOP PROVISION FOR THE FUTURE. THE MANIFESTO AIMS TO COMMIT TO THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE FINAL REPORT AND DEVELOP A COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY TO CHAMPION THE WORK DONE. THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AIMS TO DELIVER ON THESE COMMITMENTS WITHIN FIVE YEARS.
 SENSE OF BELONGING FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.", "BASED UPON SIX KEY THEMES, THE MANIFESTO IS A COMMITMENT TO ENHANCE AND CREATE A SERIES OF SUPPORT MECHANISMS WITH THE AIM OF MAKING POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE. THE MANIFESTO COMMITMENT IS STUDENT LED AND OWNED, FROM START TO FINISH, AND IS FIRMLY ESTABLISHED AS A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS, SUPPLEMENTING THE UNIVERSITY'S PARTNERSHIP APPROACHES WITH STUDENT ENGAGEMENT.", ' STUDENT FUTURES COMMISSION WEBSITE
SIX STUDENT CONSULTANTS WERE RECRUITED TO CHAMPION AND LEAD THE STUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO PROJECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. THE ROLE OF EACH STUDENT WAS TO ACT AS A CONSULTANT TO DEVELOP A STUDENT MANIFESTO THAT COMMITS TO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SIX OVERARCHING THEMES, WITH THE AIM OF IMPROVING THE ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND PROGRESSION OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN. EACH STUDENT INTERVIEWED FOR THEIR SPECIALISED THEME AND SHOWED A PASSION FOR BRINGING IMPROVEMENTS TO STUDENT LIFE, CONFIDENCE, ACADEMIC PROGRESS, AND THEIR SOCIAL SKILLS.
OUTLINE OF THE TEACHING STUDENTS RECEIVE AND THE TOOLS TO ACCESS IT
S AIMS.", "A STUDENT FUTURES MANIFESTO OVERSIGHT GROUP WAS ALSO SET UP TO GUIDE AND OVERSEE THE STUDENT CONSULTANTS. THIS GROUP INCLUDED THE DEAN OF THE LINCOLN ACADEMY OF LEARNING AND TEACHING (LALT), WITH REPRESENTATION FROM THE STUDENTS' UNION, STUDENT CONSULTANTS, AND STAFF MENTORS.", '
WORKING WITH MY STUDENT CONSULTANT GAVE ME GREATER INSIGHT INTO THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AND ALLOWED ME TO SEE AND APPRECIATE HOW A STUDENT VIEWS THE WAY IN WHICH WE PROMOTE SUPPORT SERVICES ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY.
OUR STUDENT CONSULTANTS HAVE PROVIDED A RANGE OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH OF THE THEMES IDENTIFIED BY THE WORK OF THE UPP FOUNDATION. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE INFORMED BY THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE PROJECT, AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHERE OUR STUDENT POPULATION WANT THE UNIVERSITY TO COMMIT TO TARGETED DEVELOPMENT. THESE DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD EMPOWER THE VALUES OF COMMUNITY, ENSURE DIGITAL LEARNING ENABLES WELLBEING AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND EMBODY THE KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY. FOR EACH OF THE OVERARCHING THEMES, THE COMMITMENTS AND ACTIONS ARE PROPOSED.
YOU CAN NOW DOWNLOAD AND READ THE FULL REPORT ON THE FINAL RECOMMENDATION OF THE PROJECT. THE NEXT STEPS ARE FOR TASK AND FINISH GROUPS TO BE CREATED TO PROGRESS WITH ACTIONS AND OPERATIONALISE THE FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT.
TO CREATE A SERIES OF MICROCREDENTIAL PROGRAMMES TO ALLOW PROSPECTIVE AND INCOMING STUDENTS TO BUILD UP THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPECTED KNOWLEDGE, IDENTIFY GAPS IN THIS KNOWLEDGE, AND POTENTIALLY ALLOW ACADEMIC STAFF TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE OF ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE OF A COHORT.
TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION, IN THE FORM OF A BOOKLET FOR EACH COURSE/SCHOOL CONTAINING FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING COURSE STRUCTURE, NATURE OF STUDY, AND ASSESSMENTS. THESE WOULD IDEALLY BE A PHYSICAL DOCUMENT WITH AN ONLINE VERSION AVAILABLE.
ENSURE THAT RESOURCES PROVIDED DURING WELCOME WEEK ARE ACCESSIBLE ALL YEAR ROUND, SO STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO APPROPRIATELY ACCESS THE RESOURCE THEY NEED EASILY.
STUDENTS SHOULD COMPLETE A PROJECT WITHIN THEIR FIRST WEEK IN THE FORM OF A SCAVENGER HUNT, WHICH WOULD HELP THEM ORIENTATE THEMSELVES AROUND THE UNIVERSITY AND PROVIDE THEM WITH NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT SUPPORT IS AVAILABLE.
TO REINSTATE SELF-CERTIFICATION FOR EXTENSIONS IN THE 2023/24 ACADEMIC YEAR. THIS WOULD SUPPORT STUDENTS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL TIME DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS.
CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION NEED TO BE DEVELOPED WHEN ADVERTISING SERVICES OR SUPPORTING STUDENTS WHO HAVE REACHED OUT FOR HELP. STUDENTS NEED TO BE MADE MORE AWARE OF THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM AS THEY START THEIR UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE IN THEIR FIRST YEAR OF STUDY.
ALL NEW STUDENTS DURING WELCOME WEEK NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE SUPPORT OFFERED BY THE WELLBEING CENTRE AND HOW TO CONTACT THEM.
THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM IS AN INSTRUCTIONAL APPROACH THAT TYPICALLY INVOLVES STUDENTS ENGAGING WITH PRE-RECORDED LECTURES OR MATERIALS BEFORE THE CLASS SESSION, ALLOWING FOR MORE INTERACTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE ACTIVITIES DURING IN-PERSON CLASS TIME. IT ENCOURAGES ACTIVE LEARNING, STUDENT ENGAGEMENT, AND PEER-TO-PEER INTERACTION. IT IS ALSO KEY TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE WELL-INFORMED ABOUT THE AVAILABLE TEACHING METHODS AND THEIR BENEFITS, AND IT IS RECOMMENDED TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND RESOURCES REGARDING TEACHING APPROACHES.
ENHANCE INFORMATION PROVISION TO IMPROVE THE CLARITY AND DEPTH OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS DURING THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS, PARTICULARLY REGARDING TEACHING METHODS, EXPECTATIONS, AND MAKE THE LEARNING CURVE A BIT EASIER.
ASSESS THE LEVEL OF PREPAREDNESS FOR TEACHING METHODS AND HOW THIS BENEFITS THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE
TO ADDRESS THE DESIRE FOR MORE PRACTICAL SESSIONS, THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN SHOULD FOCUS ON INTEGRATING HANDS-ON EXPERIENCES AND REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS INTO LEARNING EXPERIENCE. THIS CAN INCLUDE INCORPORATING CASE STUDIES, SIMULATIONS, OR COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS.
THIS HAS BEEN A KEY AREA THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE FOCUS GROUP, AND EVIDENT WITH THE LOW NUMBER OF RESPONSES TO THE SURVEY. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHY STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND PARTICIPATION IS LOW WHEN OPPORTUNITIES ARE GIVEN. SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS COULD BE THROUGH THE USE OF INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION.
STUDENT-LED GROUPS WITHIN THE CURRICULUM TO ENABLE COLLABORATION BETWEEN STAFF AND STUDENTS AND TRULY ENSURE LEARNING HAS A STUDENT-FOCUSED APPROACH, SUPPORTING STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE THE BEST OUTCOMES.
INCREASED EXPOSURE OF OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE CURRICULUM THAT HELP BUILD SKILLS, NETWORKS, AND COMMUNITIES
BASED ON THE SURVEY RESULTS AND COMMENTS MADE IN THE FOCUS GROUP, STUDENTS ARE EITHER NOT AWARE OF OPPORTUNITIES OR FEEL AS THOUGH THEY ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE. A RECOMMENDATION TO PROVIDE MORE EXPOSURE OF THESE WITHIN THE CURRICULUM IS TO HAVE COLLEGE-SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENTS RELEASED MONTHLY, SO THATSTUDENTS ARE AWARE OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE.
TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO BE OFFERED TO STUDENTS ALONGSIDE THEIR DEGREE TO SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR FUTURE CAREERS. THIS COULD INCLUDE ACADEMIC SKILL SUPPORT SUCH AWS TRAINING FOR BUSINESS STUDENTS, EXCEL, AND WORD CERTIFICATES. NON-ACADEMIC SKILLS COULD INCLUDE FIRST AID TRAINING, BRITISH SIGN LANGUAGE, FORMAL WRITING, OR TEAM-WORKING AND CONFIDENCE BUILDING COURSES.
TO INTEGRATE CAREERS AND EMPLOYABILITY FURTHER INTO TEACHING WITH COURSES AND MODULES TO TAKE CAREER READINESS SERIOUSLY AND BETTER PREPARE THEIR STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE.
ENSURE THAT STUDENTS KNOW WHAT ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES ARE OFFERED AND HOW THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO THEM. THIS COULD INCLUDE FEATURING THESE EVENTS WITHIN STUDENT TIMETABLES.
THE MANIFESTO AIMS TO COMMIT TO THE ACTIONS OUTLINED IN THE FINAL REPORT AND DEVELOP A COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY TO CHAMPION THE WORK DONE. THE UNIVERSITY OF LINCOLN AIMS TO DELIVER ON THESE COMMITMENTS WITHIN FIVE YEARS.

LINCOLN WAS MY FIRST CHOICE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE COURSE WAS STRUCTURED. WHEN I CAME I COULD TELL HOW MUCH THE LECTURERS REALLY CARED ABOUT THEIR STUDENTS AND IT WAS THE PERSONAL TOUCH THAT REALLY IMPRESSED ME. THEY WERE REALLY APPROACHABLE AND ACCOMMODATING TO YOUR NEEDS.
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDYING IN THE UK AND USA
STUDYING A DEGREE PROGRAMME IN THE UK IS DIFFERENT TO STUDYING IN THE USA. THE MOST NOTABLE DISTINCTION IS THE LENGTH OF DEGREE PROGRAMME. IN THE UK, A FULL-TIME BACHELORS DEGREE TYPICALLY TAKES THREE YEARS TO COMPLETE, AND A FULL-TIME POSTGRADUATE TAUGHT PROGRAMME TYPICALLY TAKES ONE YEAR TO COMPLETE. DUE TO THE REDUCED STUDY DURATION, THERE ARE NO GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS WITHIN DEGREE PROGRAMMES IN THE UK. STUDENTS SELECT THEIR MAJOR AT THE POINT OF APPLICATION, AND SUBSEQUENTLY STUDY THEIR CHOSEN SUBJECT FOR THE DURATION OF THE DEGREE PROGRAMME.
